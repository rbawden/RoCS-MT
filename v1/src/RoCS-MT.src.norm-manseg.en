My favorite Obama quote: “Michael and I also want to… uh… acknowledge… uh… uh… uh… your son Jack, who deployed today.”
New-ish player, couple of questions about parrying, etc.
Basically the title.
We’re both xxx majors (I’m a dual xxx and yyy major while she’s a xxx major and yyy minor, so we are taking 2-3 classes together every semester until graduation in May 2018).
While I wouldn’t say I’m smarter than her, things tend to come more naturally to me, and I’m a good test-taker, while she has a lot of test anxiety (she will often get questions wrong that me and her practice right before the exam, will freak out about not having a formula that was on the formula sheet, etc.), but she easily studies more than I do.
Me [20F] with my friend [23F] of 2-3 years, we’re both in college together, and she gets massively down on herself every time she takes an exam.
It’s driving me crazy, how to deal with it?
Her: Oh, where’s this ice luge, haha?
Me: Probably my friend’s hotel room or wherever he can find a place for it.
Me: I came to <insert city> with my fraternity and a sorority – that’s why he’s getting it.
Her: Gotcha!
Her: What fraternity and sorority I’m in xxx.
Me: yyy. sorority is zzz.
Me: You’re interesting though.
I want to hang out with you.
When this week?
Her: Uh, maybe Friday?
Me: Ah, yes.
Me: Friday.
*one day later*
Me: <girl’s name>, we’re hanging out tomorrow, right?
How to go from number to date?
I just pretty much dismissed what she said by saying a vibe is not captured by pre-googling and confirmed the time that I’ll be there.
If she gives any further resistance, I think I’ll just next her, ignore her, not respond to her, agree with her that she can’t handle the place, or tease her about the crazy high standards she has for a first freaking date.
This is a nagging annoyance I have with the Word text object.
Suppose the cursor is located in the “aaa” word, and I want to yank four words without selecting the spaces after “ddd”:  > xxx **aaa bbb ccc ddd** yyy
It is the bar with the team composition and the status of each character that is used to follow “report team” (like in the actual World Cup).
It can be tweaked down to not reveal too much information about the red team, but it will make following the killfeed easier, and you won’t have to use tab.
The part I’m humming is like “word word word wo-o-o-ord” twice.
So he draws out the 4th (?) word.
I think it was something like “fly-y-y-yyy.”
I’m pretty sure it’s a popular song; I’ve heard it many times.
Thanks!
I’m having trouble with if / then / else / end in a repeat loop.
Haha.
Oh my god, it’s terribly funny!
I went grocery shopping.
I’m down to my last dollars soon, and I can’t just eat beer and cigarettes.
Then I set them down so I didn’t have to carry them across the street to get beer (it’s cheaper at Adventure’s First Stop).
Then I walked back and forgot my groceries.
I walked all the way home and, ah shit, I’m getting shin splints from all this walking up and down the hill.
I live on a hill. Down. In the middle, really.
I imagine it’s like an amateur San Francisco.
So I walked back and got them.
No crime round these parts.
Not much, anyway.
I hope the title makes sense.
I have a list of names “john.baker” (no spacing between names other than the period) and need it broken into 2 columns “john” and “baker”.
Thanks!
I have to break up the format “xxx.yyy” into two separate columns “xxx” and “yyy”.
I am confused.
What’s going on, lol?
This is my first time with SFU e-mail.
After the semester I haven’t touched anything school-related until today heh, so I don’t know how to fix this.
Even better for me it would be:
It would be an unbelievable loss to let a broken and thus spilt bottle be wasted with no return.
So to show my sincerest apologies for bumping straight into a noble that half-marched in his drunken stupor down the sidewalk, straight out of a liquor store and making him drop his bottle worth more than what I suppose one of the merchants off the main street makes in a month, I was invited to finish the wasted goods, lest they spoil any further.
“Yes sir! May the heavens cry before your merciful heart!”
“Now get lost! This is no place for disease-ridden vermin like you.”
“Of course my lord!”
I ran back down the alley I squirmed my way out of. Filled to the brim with anger and shame.
Sidestreets and alleyways, down I went. Further and further out of sight.
He, as soon as he saw that I was weeping, answered,  “Come with me.”
Onward he moved, I close his steps pursued.
Entering, he led me with him on the bounds of a great circle itself encircling a great abyss.
Ere, I beheld an uneven land covered with lava pyramids, with sickly farms of melons and carrots, near barren of life save for those imprisoned in it, who, though they surrounded us, dared not approach for fear of the master.
As my ear could note, the sound was heard of screams, cries, and explosions that made the eternal air tremble, caused by slaughter, starvation, withering, and frief felt by those multitudes, many and vast, of men, women, and children.
I recently returned to D2 after several year, now I’m wondering:
Where do you guys sell or buy your stuff?
Do you just make a game “O xxx N yyy” and hope for the best?
Or is there a website that’s more efficient?
Who is a former (or still) important person in your country, that constantly compromises himself/herself on social media?
It’s not until my next billing cycle that I noticed something was off.
I was a bit lower than normal and I keep a very close eye on my expenses.
I looked over my bank statements and there it was:
My new Prime bill.
I was super confused and got hold of Amazon’s customer support.
They helped me as much as they could, but because I was receiving my service through the phone company, I would have to go though them and figure out the problem.
The next day that I had off, I walked in and talked to a very sweet girl, who tried to understand what my problem was.
We kind of talked in circles for a bit as I tried to explain what the Amazon customer service told me.
We looked me up in their system and there I was: 2 lines, but no Prime membership for either one of us.
She could see the date I opened my first line and then the second.
Both dates added up to what I had told her before.
She stared at the computer screen for a while with a confused look on her face.
Anyways, these terrible memories kept haunting me, so yesterday I finally mustered up the courage to message him.
Me: Hey, how’s everything?
Him: It’s been a long time.
Me: Sorry about last year.
I was super awkward around you, lol.
Him: lol, no, don’t worry about it.
*drum roll please*
Me: To be honest, I liked you blah blah blah…
Him: Haha, you could’ve just told me!
Next time you see me just say hi.
Do you still go to <school>?
I’m not like r/Nicegirls but that reply didn’t sit well with me.
I’m out, boys :-)
Now I obviously can’t get out and shut it on the main road, so I pull down a few side streets and ensure that no one fucking knows I’ve quickly jumped out and shut it.
I jump back in and drive home like nothing’s happened.
I don’t remember specifically which, I think both bugs do it, but here in Florida, there’s a particular bug that makes a loud sound 100 times longer than when it’s not making a sound.
I’d describe it as that trademark desert ambiance sound.
Locusts, grasshoppers, etc. can shut the hell up.
I’ve searched far and wide across the internet with nothing to show for it.
They could even go woah eee ahh ahh/oh eee ahh.
The possibilities are endless and I know it’s hard.
I’m just wondering if anyone knows it, thanks!
What to do: my plant’s now way too small for its age in my opinion and has started to grow pistils.
Should I chop and restart or…?
How do you get destiny delicacies?
I’ve seen a few people have them, but I’ve never got one.
I don’t know where you get them.
If anyone knows, it would be a lot of help :-)
Every time I listen to him, shit makes so much sense, even though I don’t know what he is talking about.
That leads me to believe that either that guy is a genius who can articulate what’s going on in the economy right now in a brilliant way, or he may be missing something.
I mean what should I listen to if I really want to find out the truth, if Schiff is just “biased toward gold”, and that’s the reason why he is so hard on the current economy, etc.
This wouldn’t be an issue if all your servers asked at the beginning “do you guys want a separate check so it won’t be awkward.”
Also, why restaurants have to be set up like that? Why can’t you just get up to the cashier and pay for your fucking share of the food?
Why can’t you just get up to the cashier and pay for your fucking share of the food?
So I don’t know why I got on everyone’s nerves about the separate checks…
But every time, my narcissistic mom says that it can’t be true, because when she was my age, her periods were 3 days long and super light.
“It barely ever affected me, so how can it be affecting you so much?”
Um, I don’t know, maybe it’s because we’re different people with different bodies?
Does anyone else’s narcissistic mom treat you like you’re overreacting about your period pains?
I passed my FAA PPL written!
Alright everyone, I think I mis-tagged this earlier, so I’m trying again.
I got some not fun fungal acne from running daily with a face mask on my chin/jawline, forehead, and lower cheeks.
Once I identified it, I switched from a face mask to a face shield while running (I have no issue with being over 12 feet from other people - I usually don’t pass anyone on my runs anyways), and then I have used the following routine to nuke it over the course of 3 weeks.
I had never heard of this “influencer” before and consider myself pretty internet savvy.
I then lost interest in her, because her Instagram wasn’t that interesting.
She popped back on my radar with the Nancy thread, and then she disappeared from my mind again until the Anna article came out, and then I took a great interest in checking in on her, because I just found her funny and her antics amusing (in a sad way).
So this has been on my mind for a while:
How does she continue to have such loyal fans who will send her lots of money, because she claims to not be able to afford food or rent or whatever, when there is photographic evidence all over her apartment of her bougie taste in decor, perfumes (Byredo perfume costs anywhere from $200-300 a pop), shit tons of plants and flowers, which aren’t cheap.
Basically, I just found out that this 1 girl is only snapping me again because my friend basically told her to (told a friend to tell her), and now I’m 99% sure she’s just snapping me to be nice (plus the delivery times and opened times shit are mad long).
What should I do from here?
Someone please let me know.
Like, I don’t really care what mean, shit people on the internet say.
But when I got nobody in real life, all I have is the internet, and it does kind of hurt a bit when I just want to vent my problems.
And I’d be fine if it got maybe a single upvote and no comments, and I’d be fine.
But instead, it’s full of people saying
I don’t like when people type huge paragraphs or dump a lot of stress on me about their problems.
I don’t like when people mumble on the phone or if they ramble on, and it’s all about them.
I’m talking about “ppl” instead of people “u” or “ur” instead of “you” or “your”, “tho” instead of “though” and so on.
It’s getting old, and you look like an idiot when you spell like this.
Just type out the word.
It isn’t hard.
Maybe a little earlier, I don’t know, because I’m usually at work, but my download speed is now stuck at the 64mb/s range.
Now I understand at peak times it should drop, I even understand that since more people are at home I’m going to see lower numbers, but to go from 500 to 60…
I’m curious how likely it is that a post on my personal space will be shown to people.
Please write  “+” in the comment if you see this.
Hm, mandatory title.
If anyone says anything remotely offensive on the internet, everyone just has to say you can die or something.
Do we really care that much?
Not really, to be honest.
Damn, some people need to stop overreacting to stuff on the internet, Jesus!
I’ve come up with a list of all the questions I could think about (there’s kind of a lot, lol), so I would really appreciate it if someone would take the time to answer them.
If anyone is willing to PM me and chat about their test day experience and answer all my questions, that would be great too!
I’m gross and only brush in the morning.
I guess I don’t see the need, because who the fuck cares?
But now it seems that you’re all making grits without the butter and making us madder than a wet hen, I must say!
We were preparing to tour more plantations than Carter’s got little pills but you done gone and brought up them “slave owners” now.
It isn’t amounting to anything more than a hill of beans!
If I had my druthers, I’d have just taken my business over yonder to the white-friendly plantation and learnt something decent about history.
All this chicanery has got me worn slap out!
You get along now, do you hear?
How do I break off a relationship with my “friend”?
Basically, I put my skate account in my Instagram biography, because I have no posts on my main, and I’m kind of insecure about my body (in some of my clips I’m shirtless, and people won’t expect me to be like shredded or some shit if they add me), and today I got 3 followers (girls from different towns who don’t know me).
I’m really picky though, because I don’t want to have a relationship, unless I actually feel like I’d really like the person and be into them a lot, so I didn’t follow any of them back.
Bro, I’ve been added and un-added on Instagram so many times today that it’s kind of a confidence boost, lmao.
Honestly, most of the posts or memes here are either from people who read the novels or the manga.
I have to dodge so many spoilers, smh…
I have nothing else to say, come at me angry people, lmao.
Hi guys, I’m a casual just-for-fun gamer, playing 5-6 games a week.
Yesterday it was just pure horror division 10…
I could not win 1 game out of 6…
Like, is everyone smurfing ?
Or what’s going on?
I know people want to play the objective.
I get that, but why do you need to shush or watch full replay or every cut scene?
So basically, for my A-levels I got 82 RP and wanted to go the NUS business administration but didn’t get in, though I’m quite sure my grade is good enough, and my appeal was rejected 3 days ago… *welp* :-(
I got into SMU business administration, but I still feel damn shit that I didn’t get into NUS, so help change my mind and convince me why SMU is better than NUS, especially for business :-/
I’m most scared that in the future when I’m working, people will look down on SMU like elitism discrimination all that, I don’t know, man.
Or will they pay less or not even hire me?
RIP, because SMU is kind of 2nd best and less well known.
I would really appreciate if you all could help me out, especially those who are currently at university or have already left.
Thanks pals :-)
TLDR: the title.
Other vegans that you’re friends with tell you that they don’t tell other people that they’re vegan.
Like, they purposefully avoid it.
I feel like it fucks over the vegan community, because they are probably the people that would be more gentle with their words, which is what some people need in order to listen.
I’m a very straightforward, no sugarcoating type of person, and although some people appreciate it, a lot more get upset and start trying to put words in my mouth and twisting things.
Fellow vegans, does it annoy you when...
You honestly deserve to get scammed if you give a random guy on the internet like €300 worth of fake internet points, like, what the fuck are you doing, honestly? lol
Why would you give awards to people? lol
Yes, I agree things like Tumblr made-up identities are weird, and some people do get offended easily, but if what you said is ignorant/bigoted, calling people snowflakes is just weak.
Give yourself a pat on your back if you believed and trusted Tom from the start to the end without any unsureness and trusted him and never lost hope in the series! Props to you!
The New Year’s Eve Raticate with a hat.
I haven’t found him anywhere yet.
Does anyone want to raid?
I need a few people quick.
Stop.
I think what I am trying to say… this game is not hard.
Don’t make it hard yourself.
The main objective, as I understood, is to get the dragon, and don’t die before that.
Even better if you outfarm your opponent.
Just don’t die.
And trades in lane… if you see the enemy using his escape ability or even damage ability.
And I offered to go out to look at Christmas lights, but he was out of town.
So we couldn’t do that, and now he’s back in town, and I asked him what he’s doing on New Year’s Eve and he said he was going to hang out with two of the managers from our work.
And like, he didn’t offer an invite, and then he said if he cancels with them, would I like to come over, and I just said I don’t know what I’m doing yet, so I don’t know.
Am I overthinking this?
Does he not care?
There are going to be people on the internet saying “stat padder” but other than his weird hesitancy to drive, he played pretty solid.
Hey, the regulars!
I just wanted to say that I love the group channel, it’s amazing, and love your own channels as well.
I love all your videos, and I have a suggestion for a video for the channel:
Do a Minecraft build battle and whoever loses there, the other people get to write something on their Twitter, lol.
I hope you like my idea and can use it for a video.
I have a group chat.
It’s on Discord for people who are bored or want to chat about anything.
We already have some people who chat and stuff about anything.
It’s chill, edgy, and if you want to join, comment and I’ll direct message you the link.
I just kind of realized that I’ve never had New Year’s Eve plans...
I always think about how I haven’t been able to throw birthday parties or shit like that…
I recently realized that I still don’t have enough friends to have one for my 21st coming up…
I don’t know why I didn’t clue into this though.
Like, I never thought about how people have traditions for this night, besides my sister, who goes out to her friends’ every year.
It’s funny that Covid isn’t affecting my New Year at all…
Is anyone else in the same boat?
Anyway, I guess I’ll just watch a movie tonight, lol.
Hello, I’m looking for people to talk to, maybe play some games or watch anime together.
Just please be aware that I’m not very good at upholding conversations. uwu F/20
Like, I see videos on YouTube on it.
But like, I can’t see any mention on the design notes, etc.
Where do people get the information from?
DM me to debate.
Please be well learned in your belief.
I want DMs, because it’ll get deep and I can’t reply to 300 people like that.
Also, I need 500 characters so here come the blah blahs.
I’m not saying that they should be ashamed to be turned into girls or that I’m being stereotypical towards a person being a girl, but I am saying that they won’t like to do it, because they are humans with their own choices, and not agreeing to be a girl isn’t making them a women anti.
Like, how many guys around you would be willing to be turned into Disney princesses or to play that butt game?
Maybe they get used to this with time but how much time?
And maybe they know that they have to do all this for the entertainment of fans.
But knowing this isn’t making anything better for them until they happily and genuinely agree to it.
I sometimes feel sad for them when they are asked to do all this.
I wouldn’t like it if you tried to make me a man and wanted me to dance in front of so many people, even though I am a tomboy.
Is anyone missing me?
If you miss a Reddit friend, read this.
It could be me!
So I just hopped on PC from PS4, not even 2.5k games played there.
I played a few decent games since I frankly suck with a keyboard and mouse, and yet for the past week or so I am matching with people 2000 kills and predators even.
Yet I haven’t even a hundred games played and about 80 kills with all characters.
I’m not really having fun anymore.
I can’t improve if I get shit on every game.
I see a lot of people on here who seem hella sad, so if you’re really sad, I’m up for a chat.
So yeah if you are up for a chat, or long-term friendship, I’ll be more than happy to do so.
So I always see people talk about sending designs and edits to Affinity, but how do I do that?
I’ve worked at OD for almost a year and none of management has mentioned it.
Like not even the print suppliers.
We do every type of editing in store and I hate it.
Like we’re out here doing stuff that I’m pretty sure is supposed to get sent out to Affinity based on what I see on here.
But yeah, is more of this information on the store portal or where can I learn more?
I’m extremely tired of creating/editing shit for last-minute, rude customers :-)
One person in the server was selling the set for 100k, and I was like “Hell no, that’s not worth 100k”, like bruh.
Why do people find the new set expensive?
I know the girl I posted about is a troll people, but oh well, she’s got her 6 minutes of fame time to take the posts down.
Hit me up with a chat message.
Tell me about yourself and we can go from there.
I don’t understand how people can build what they do...
I love building but I guess my creativity isn’t well tuned as a lot of people’s is, and it bothers me that I can’t build amazing stuff.
I know I could if had the creative side, ugh!
I just tend to give up after a while and settle for simple crap to pass for ok.
I care about how I affect people a lot but try not to show it.
It’s hard for me to join in conversations with big groups of people, which is related to ADHD.
Sometimes my sensitivity can make me kind of stand-offish to people I don’t know.
I’ll try to act like I don’t care if someone doesn’t like me but drunk people will fall to the floor begging them to.
These all are ADHD things though, because of rejection sensitive dysphoria.
I’m a good listener. A lot of people view me as really cute or innocent.
I can have a really, really, really flirty personality at times.
I remember in high school, my friend’s mom said I had the “personality”, so I’d probably be the first to have a boyfriend.
But when she’s in the wrong or when someone holds her accountable, she just throws the biggest temper tantrum ever and just disrespects anyone/everyone who doesn’t agree with her and screams about how she doesn’t care.
Or more specifically in her words “I don’t give a fuck”.
She’ll never take accountability or apologize and becomes the biggest hypocrite.
All the things she screams at people to not do to her, she turns around and does the exact same rude, petty shit to anyone/everyone else that doesn’t agree with her.
I think the main reason she does this is because my sister acts just like my mom, and my mom can’t stand it/accept that
So she becomes downright nasty.
In class, I’ve usually been really quiet, but sometimes I’ll meet someone I click with in class and be really, really chatty.
I think I get along best with girly fun girls, overly confident queen B, feisty type people, and just gossipy people.
My friends and their families see me as really bubbly and excitable.
Although most people see me as sweet, soft spoken, and quiet.
Some people think I never talk though.
I’ve always been a smiley, happy person though.
I do really like making others happy or seeing people I know and having a friendly conversation.
I have ADHD.
Sometimes I’m at a loss for words or boring.
I’m really, really chatty when drunk.
Although sometimes I’m not when drunk - I heard people with ADHD are both.
Could I be ISTP?
Help type me please.
I don’t know if people would even want to.
I just want to know if that’s allowed, and if not, where would be a good place to post that.
(I’ve watched Dragonmar and other people’s videos but that would be hard to be a me-specific video on there)
Like in a good way though.
Some people are just indescribable.
I haven’t done this before, but I’ve seen enough to get a gist of it so like…interests :-)
We can definitely talk about anime (especially romance - I’m a sucker for it), we can talk about games and go into detail about lore and stuff, creepy stories go hard, and really I’m just down for anything :-)
I’m not gonna be weird so long as you’re not weird.
Any age or anything is fine with me and uh yeah… if I didn’t do this right let me know :-)
Oh and I’ll absolutely talk more on Snap.
I mean yeah, to be honest it is.
I care about a lot of people and I can’t just... make people be happy.
But like… I want to :-(
I just want to make everybody I care about happy.
Like, is that too much to ask?
I think that some people here are AI or something.
smh, don’t even try.
I can do that by myself 🤠
Hey, F/19, bored as fuck.
I enjoy talking to new people.
Hit me up!
I started chatting with her and a co-worker of hers who was in high school in the late 90’s.
She said everyone was watching wrestling back then, and it was a cool thing.
Now no one gives a shit 😭 (I don’t really blame them sometimes).
I asked her “why do you think people stopped liking it”, and she said “because it’s garbage.
It’s come on Fox on Fridays and as soon as 7 o’clock hits, I change the channel”.
I had to include that in there, because she’s so funny 😂😂😂
Anyways…
Hey, I can’t fall asleep and this platform seems pretty interesting.
Hit me up if you think we could hit it off well.
I hope we have a great time, future chat buddy ;-) 😁
It’s kind of weird, I’m not going to lie.
These motherfuckers can outrun, outswim or outstam (through venom) anything that tries to get them.
Mine is literally covered in scars head to toe from escaped or successful fights.
I just finished the show so I’m a little behind everyone but equally obsessed and want to talk about it so much, lol.
Also by sidestory I mean something that’s not part of the main plot!
One of the best games ever that I have played!
But I have some problems…
I’d always heard of Mac for years but never really checked him out in detail until a couple of months ago, and now he’s one of my favorite and most often listened to artists right now.
Anyway, those were just my thoughts.
Happy New Year’s everyone!
I hope the new year treats you well.
Now for this one, it’s kind of hard, because the enemies are so cool for this game, but... If I had to choose, I’d say I like the clown the most.
I just think their design and movement is super neat.
Plus they are one of the few if not the only enemy in the game that doesn’t have a single other variation from what I remember.
Honestly, I wasn’t going to make one, but I want to at least give my two cents especially since I disagree with a lot of others’ lists.
Not to say that my list is right, because this is all subjective anyway, which is why I hate making them.
Here we go again, another character fighting tier list!
Yay!
In my opinion, Lily for the most part is a rather likeable character (keep in mind I’ve only played a bit of season 1 up to like part of episode 3).
Unlike her father, Lily tries to work with Lee and for the most part the group.
She does what she has to.
She is a bit of a bitch, because she has to.
I only have 1 problem with Lily.
She killed Carly.
If you could get Ben to confess…
Yes, I got spoiled on that and a few other things.
Ben is useless.
He is what looks like a college student, yet he is useless and needs rescuing 24/7.
Please don’t downvote me into oblivion if I missed something.
I pretty much just use it for drums and I like making complex beats.
So 4 isn’t really cutting it anymore and piano roll editing drums kind of sucks in my opinion.
Is there a way to make the step sequencer into 8th or 16th notes in FL?
I’m not a trans man, but I am interested in knowing someone’s perspectives who has lived both as a woman and as a man.
(Not a lot of people get to experience what it is like to be perceived as both genders)
So that’s kind of neat in my opinion.
I don’t think he did the role justice.
I feel before Neo figured it out, the way he was speaking was ok, but after… in my opinion, he should have gone full Hugo Weaving speech.
I just wanted to share my opinion not being a United fan, on the game against Burnley.
(Not that many of you will care).
McTominay - sheesh, what a guy.
I thought that Shaw was solid.
Now you’ve got two good left backs in good form.
Also I wanted to say AWB had a much better game, I thought.
After the shitty games and Dalot playing well I personally thought AWB improved a lot.
I would be fine if it was changed to tome can only drop at 4-6,
Yes this also ties into the item drop timing issues, but for me I can live with those issues but not this.
Please change!
It’s kind of an odd question in my opinion, but I have a ball python who I just got to eat frozen/thawed for the first time (yay!), but she seems to prefer medium rats.
I’ve tried frozen/thawed large rats with no success.
First medium I offer and I got her to eat.
It could be a fluke though.
I know it’s like a meme or something of “Dark Souls player complains about the combat” or something similar, but I just don’t get the combat.
I can do DS3 Deathless, I know how to parry at about above average skill, I have played a shit ton of Ghost of Tsushima lately.
I know it’s not a difficult game, but hear me out real quick if you know the game.
Oh my God!
Why do so many morons try to download PC game torrents when firstly they don’t have any idea of how a torrent even works (it’s so damn easy though!).
Comments like “The link doesn’t work”, rofl!
Yes, it works completely fine!
You’re just way too dumb to know you need a torrent program.
😤 Idiot morons 😡😡🤬
So I get tipped on the app, they gave me cash at the door, then took away the tip on the application after?
What the fuck is even the point of that?
This shit has never happened before, but now it’s happened 3 times this week.
Once the cash tip was less than the app tip...
If you are tipping both, tip both.
Not going to lie, Teamfight Tactics is a good mode, but it’s like Hearthstone a good game to play on your phone, not something to grind out all day all night, like what the fuck?
It’s not even that engaging (ideal game to turn on, prep up and alt tab until it’s next time you can do anything).
Any thoughts?
I know it’s a scientific things and all, but some of the posts there are just too much.
Learning dream languages?
What the fuck?
And some bloke is saying “I tried the 3 jump and eat banana method but didn’t lucid dream?!” every few hours.
Maybe the posts are just getting a little too imaginative?
Like everyone is gathered and shows fake smile, fake dance, fake love and I am like “Dear lord, what the fuck is happening, ooh”.
So I am a first time cup user, and I got the Saalt cup at Target.
I decided to do a dry run in the shower today, and it went in pretty fine after a few different fold methods were attempted (C-fold + 17 year-old virgin = ow).
I got it in with the 7-fold, and it may not have been perfect but a great first try.
I go to take it out and how the fuck am I supposed to do this with my long ass acrylic nails?
In one way, it kind of helped me find the cup lowkey grip, but god damn was it difficult trying not to stab myself.
I didn’t think about nails...
Is he going to tell her?
If so how would that conversation go down?!
Okay, what the fuck! Arlo now knows Sera (I don’t know how to spell her full name) is John’s weakness.
First of all, we’ve seen they are greedy as fuck (OK, not as much other mobile studios, but still).
Second, the game needs a lot of work to work well (even if it was designed for high-end phones).
Even that (oh, Allah may forgive me) damn Fornite mobile is better optimized nowadays.
What the fuck are you Yanks on?

I’m never moving to canada.
Sometimes it will cause me to have racing thoughts, others it chills me the fuck out and gives me nods similar to codeine.
Why the hell is this?
I think it has something to do with whether or not a woman looks at me and thinks I’m ugly.
If that happens, I get anxious from it.
But if a women looks at me and feels indifferent and even thinks I’m decent looking, I get good effects from the stuff.
What the fuck is going on?
If you shoot an enemy then crouch to become invisible, even if they don’t detect you, they will waltz right over to exactly where you are.
Sneak is garbage in this game.
I should’ve just grabbed a submachine gun and power armor.
I finally beat him after so many tries, most of them being on his second phase.
His 3rd phase I beat first time.
I got 7th place on the last event with Magaki but have 2960 points and get 50 frags instead of 80 for 7-10 place.
Why?
Because I have less than 3000 points.
(I need 55 Magaki frags and I get 50 - just feel my suffering)
Also in another event with gamer764 I have around 8000 points and got 4th place and got rewards for 4th place, not for 1st.
What is it with needing 7k points or more?
Are the developers too greedy?
I made plans to go camping during a day we were going to see each other, and I got a bunch of texts on how she wished I was still free Wednesday, and so I canceled it, and now she won’t stop saying sorry that’s not what she meant.
What the fuck do I do?
I told her I was going on another one next month (lie) to make her feel better, but I didn’t.
But I don’t necessarily need top of the line if that also means the light will be heavy and bulky.
I prefer high speed, low drag equipment.
Would prefer to use AA batteries rather than being tethered to 16850s.
Can you recommend something?
Thanks!
Okay, so I’ve got less than a chapter left in Gardens of the Moon and I still can’t understand what the fuck Oponn is trying to achieve through all their/its meddling.
Is there something I’m missing, is it continued in another book, or is it just a dead end?
It actually got like 7 updoots.
You all are whack.
What the fuck! I posted a literal anime foot and still didn’t even make most controversial post of the day, let alone of all time.
So huh, you can’t alpha Karthus ult?
What the fuck is this bullshit?
It would be very helpful if all of you original posters out there actually said what the fuck it was that everyone is talking about before going on a banter about it!
Such as “now I understand why this [brand name] thing has everyone going crazy”…
To someone that is not constantly in the loop about the different changes, that doesn’t mean much to me.
If it’s too long to type, reference the original post, news article, video, whatever at the beginning of your post.
And the scary thing, I am not in the “DFW teams are cursed” camp or a #FireJD type.
However, some of this stuff is bugging me too much.
When Corey Perry being signed by the Stars is not the biggest potential what the fuck transaction among DFW teams, that is a bad sign.
I’m building a PC, but in the meantime I’m using a crappy 13-year-old PC.
I got money for Rust, bought it and it took 4 hours to download, 1 hour to load and 5 hours to load a server.
After I hit a tree with my rock, my game crashed.
At this time it was 12:47 am and I just said fuck it and went to bed ready for a whole lot of shit today.
EM opens the door: May I help you?
Me: Yes! Why did you give your kid permission to enter my house without my permission?
EM: GT just wanted Smores and to find treasure.
GT pulls out one of the treasures from his backpack.
My girlfriend’s face just turned red, because the treasure he found was her dildo.
My girlfriend snatches that out of GT’s hand.
GF: This isn’t meant for kids.
GT: But it’s mine - I found it and finders keepers.
EM: Give him back his treasure.
Me: Why the fuck are you not watching your son, EM, because he has embarrassed my girlfriend and entered my home without permission.
Stop!
Me: Yes, ma’am.
EM: What are you listening to?
Me: Better Off Dead from Josh A.
EM: What?!
EK: mom, stop!
Me: Bett-
EM: I heard you. What is that cover? *points to album cover*
Me: Oh, I think that’s a reference to cu-
EM: *cuts me off again* to satanic ritual.
Me: No, not at all.
EK: Mom, please stop!
EM: No, EK, this is a bad man.
EM (to me): Now give me your phone.
It was at this moment I knew this was a entitled parent.
Me: No.
EM: But my EK needs it. He’s got his degree.
EK: Mom, I’m 10.
Me: *coughs* Damn!
EM: How dare you swear in front of my son?
Yes, she said that damn was a cuss.
Me: Damn is not a cuss word.
She left for another dude (a player), has strung me along this whole time pretty much and been hot and cold.
Now she’s on to another guy as of the end of March and is currently on vacation with him for 9 days in another state.
However, she takes the same bike trail as me (the only one) for the past few months and we run into each other every couple weeks and have small talk.
About a week and a half ago, we talked for well over an hour on the trail.
Kind of disrespectful to the new boyfriend, huh?
We get along and she told me happy birthday on May 3rd.
However, I will not be wishing her one today.
Birthdays are a big deal to her, but I can’t think of a reason why I should…
After going “uh no?”, she sends me a picture of said candle holder from her kitchen.
I of course go “what the fuck, you’re home?”, and it turns out she left an hour ago from the hospital.
No updates.
No phonecall.
So I’m beyond pissed that I was even concerned for three days.
TLDR: sickly narcisstic mom went into hospital for 3 days.
I find out she’s home because of a candle holder.
It’s been a few years and I don’t care to look back so long as we can be happy together, but it’s really hard for her.
The thing that hurts her the most is that I let her go through my phone after finding the nudes and there was a message I sent to someone on Facebook in response to her calling me beautiful because of a song I made that I was sharing.
I was very flirtatious, maybe more so than I was with my girlfriend when I was first talking to her, and that has been echoing in my girlfriend’s mind.
It’s been extremely difficult for her.
We have two dogs now.
I was hoping us having two puppies to love would help draw her back to being in love with me again, because we have them to bond over, but she still can’t say “I love you too”.
She doesn’t accept when I try to give her compliments, because I’ve said rude things in the past when I used to drink (2 years ago).
You can try fancy elaborate games, but if you stink and dress like shit, best of luck to you, but I don’t see it happening.
Working as a waiter has definitely forced me to up my grooming by trimming my nails, wearing Versace Crystal Noir and other fragrances etc., which I believe is the reason why most girls, even if they’re taken, at least are willing to have a conversation with me.
Rejection is the ultimate tool for self-development, and even though I’ve been shot down by countless numbers of women in my life, I never let it get me down and I’m so proud of myself for even having the confidence to speak to these women, even though I may not have Hollywood good looks or charisma like Will Smith xD.
You guys are all beautiful and I wish you all the best of success with finding your companions :-)
She’s 18 inches long and weighs 56 grams at 15 months.
I’m just curious if this is a pretty average growth rate for females or is she growing really fast?
She eats like an absolute champion every 4-5 days and she’s already longer than some males get, so I’m curious!
The anime is about a main character that’s in a game, but she doesn’t realise it, but the system says she’s dead and etc.
I would like to watch the rest of it, so please help me.
Looking for an anime.
I don’t know if to others it’s strange, but to me it was.
I got Covid by kissing another guy for the first time, so I had to tell my mum.
I could’ve just lied and said it was because of sharing cups or kissing a girl, since I’m bi-sexual, but I knew my parents would be accepting...
So I told them as it was.
My mum was very disappointed, because she thought she knew me well, and though I told her everything, but now she couldn’t trust me anymore, because blah blah blah…
Basically, he was very disappointed in me, and actually took time to convince her that I didn’t feel like telling her, because it’s private to me... until today.
She doesn’t really trust me like before, but she’s ok, lol.
Today it’s my birthday, so I’m sharing my “strange” coming out story.
So me and my friend started playing Valorant again and want us to learn communications such as heaven and all of that.
Now I know what heaven is, but I don’t know others, and if there is a website I would be happy to have to look at it :D
(If you’re still confused, I’ll give a scenario: “I hit the Jett, she’s in heaven”, like the location.
She’s an awesome cook, does all the grocery shopping.
My aunt and I will be helping out too, but she’s not a good cook either, lol.
So I want to make their lives easier by meal prepping, and to make sure my mom is eating well.
She can’t be eating junk recovering!
(I got this a lot where a girl gets hired and I have to help them, they are always rude to me for no reason, unless the woman is older or it’s a guy)
She’s all nice and sweet to everyone else, but she’s just rude to me.
She will take credit from me and blame me when stuff goes wrong (not to my face).
The moment she is around guys and other people, she belittles me.
She talks good about herself, takes my credit then blames me when something goes wrong and everyone in my department goes along with it., which is wrong.
When she is there, she doesn’t do any work and clowns around with the guys but only when the managers aren’t there.
The worst part about it is that people really like her and think me and her are close friends.
The “false advertising” on the A4 passive is very easy to understand if you just read the whole skill, where it says multiple buffs can’t co-exist.
Maybe I’m the only one, but I think this is all dumb and also kills a lot of people’s excitement.
I don’t like to hear people freaking out for no reason over a five star, lol.
It’s just like Zhongli.
He was fine, but everyone freaked, because he wasn’t doing enough to dumpster content and was balanced.
I’ve seen lots of people in the fandom make rude or racist comments about Liberty and it’s disgusting.
Please leave her alone.
And you do realize she’s black?
Stop making fun of the actors’ ethnic features.
It’s honestly rude and not cute.
There is nothing wrong with her lips or having big lips in general.
It’s not even funny.
Honestly, it’s just sick and not cool to behave like that.
And it’s not even just Liberty. I’ve seen people talk about Sav and also Jimmy’s hair.
(Also moderators, please don’t take this down.
I really want people to see it, and I have done nothing wrong.
I’ve been having some of my posts randomly deleted for no reason)
(As simple as removing the salad and remaking it without guacamole.)
She then told me we gave her less meat, when I brought back the same plate without guacamole.
She’s home for the first time!
She’s finally back!
I am making this because of one reason only.
I have to keep my puppy in her crate at night, because if I don’t she will poop on the floor.
So there’s already 6-8 hours of her being inactive.
Then I have work, which is again 6-8 hours.
I have to keep my Corgi in my bathroom at this time, because if I don’t, she will reek havoc unsupervised.
Am I the asshole for starting a fight with an old friend (strong swearing)?
So me and my crush were on a group chat on Snapchat with my friend.
Me and my friend were arguing as a “joke” and then she said she preferred older guys, and my friend was (M14), and I said I’m a year older than you, and she says “what I mean by older guys, I mean aged 17” and it hurt my heart.
TLDR: My crush says she prefers dudes who are 17 years old and I’m 16 and she’s 15 and it broke me down.
Hello I am new on here, but I don’t know if I am the butthole or entitled one this story.
This is short, but I was expecting to get a tattoo for my 18th birthday like any 18-year-old, but I wanted to go to this one shop that my brother goes to.
I sent a direct message to the artist I wanted, but nothing for 2 months.
Like yeah, I understand they are booked for summer tattoos, but at least say “Hey I am booked for the rest of ____”.
But I was like “ok, well I am going to look at another artist’s work from this shop that does small tattoos.”
Same thing happens: no answer.
So me and my brother decide “ok, let’s go to the shop and ask, then we will at least get a answer”.
We go, and this young girl attends to us. Let’s call her Brenda.
I told her everything.
Brenda said “well you can do the tattoo with me”.
I said “I’ll be back. I’ll think about it”.
I got back in the car and scrolled through her work.
It was good work, so I went back and told her “yeah let’s do this”.
I signed everything.
She didn’t even ask for ID, which I found weird, because I had gotten my piercings done by the same shop and they needed to have ID on records and so on.
I brushed it off, since she’s new and all.
She worked on me for an hour, told me all the necessary tattoo care stuff and said after 3 or 4 weeks to let her know if there need to be fixes and that it was on her.
I was like “ok, great, thanks!”
4 weeks passed and there were a lot of mistakes made, because I got a small tattoo heartbeat with a “;” in the middle, but the period on top was a small heart.
The right side of the heart was smaller then the other side, and some of the lines were thick to thin then broke to thick again.
So I reset it, and yeah oops, I was doing it wrong all this time.
Did anyone else kick it away and get mad it wasn’t dying?
Then afterwards she began to text very dry, and like through text she kind of sounded mad.
I texted her in the night yesterday asking if she’s mad, and like she said she’s only a bit let down.
I was really confused afterwards as she began to drag text me, and like I apologized to her and she said its alright.
Then I just told her I’m going to sleep, and she just left my message on delivered and, like, she didn’t reply until today.
How to tell whether she’s mad at me or just annoyed, because right now I’m really confused?
Would I be the asshole if I was just a bigger sarcastic asshole to another asshole?
Her tumors are beginning to open through her skin, she won’t jump, painkillers don’t help, she ate a lot yesterday but won’t eat or drink today, she hid most the day, but... it’s hard, because she’s alert.
It feels wrong, because she looks at me like “I love you.
I’m happy you’re here with me.”
But the vet said she wasn’t even supposed to live this long, and the tumors will only get worse, and even if we had done chemotherapy, it would have only prolonged it.
My friend told my girlfriend something.
She then broke up with me.
I don’t know what to do now, because she and the ex-friend were the only people that I had.
What should I do to try and regain my relationship, because she’s helped me through a lot over our 2 years of dating?
TLDR: My girlfriend broke up with me because of something someone said, and I want to regain my relationship with my girlfriend.
He waited for me to leave to fire someone who has been a dedicated employee, because she’s a person of color with tattoos and “fits the part” of someone he considered would be on drugs.
It makes me sick.
I reported all this high up, because I need to protect my staff, but I’m worried that this will turn around and bite me.
My ex loves kids.
She was playing Captain Save a Hoe, almost caught a domestic case over this woman’s situation with this girl’s “crazy” baby daddy.
They moved fast.
They were in each other’s life.
It hasn’t even been two months!
I’m so hurt.
She never wanted to build a life with me.
I knew she would be all in if I had a kid on me.
They’ve grown out to the point they look kind of awkward, and she’s saying I should get them filled, but would it be weird or bad (like for my nails) or anything to ask about getting them completely redone with something I’d like better?
Aah!
She said she might have some clothes that fit me.
I’m dying!
She’s so supportive and nice, oh my God!
So, it’s 0:34 the first of January while posting this, and my sister (F14) just ruined my New Year by calling my mum fat and telling her she’s a drinker when she poured herself a glass of champagne, which she only does on her birthday on Christmas Eve and on New year.
Now my parents are pissed off, my grandparents are pissed off, and my sister thinks she was funny.
The same thing happened on Christmas Eve, and now the whole feeling of New Year is gone and I hate my sister.
P.S. English is my second language so sorry for my spelling.
Screw INTJ’s.
Why have they got to be good at everything?
It was a mistake getting the booster the day before New Year’s.
I feel like absolute dog water.
Literally most of today we spent cuddling and talking about random shit and I almost cried 🙏
I’m so happy, bro.
She’s so cool.
I’m going to ask her to be my girlfriend at midnight :-)
Also, happy New Year’s Eve and happy New Year everyone!
First of all, the satisfaction I get from saying I am the manager when customers ask for one is amazing.
A high I’ll never come off of.
Second of all, a customer comes in for the second time, mad because I didn’t do copies from a book because of copyright.
She goes “well, I called customer service and they said you were not supposed to reject me like that”.
And I’m like ??, ma’am it’s in our policy.
I don’t care what customer service says.
She keeps on being rude and yapping then throws the book on the counter and goes “make my copy”.
Like, lol, not when you act rude like that.
Our cat is getting fixed on the 11th, and she’s such a cuddly, loving, little girl and I love her cuddles every night and in the morning.
I’m just scared that she isn’t going to be like that after she gets fixed.
Am I overthinking it?
Do you think since she’s in the habit now and loves cuddles and such she’ll do it all her life?
Me and my partner have this running joke that I don’t fart.
It started out as a joke after I told her that as an answer to a truth or dare question on our first date.
Recently she’s been asking me if I’ll fart in front of her.
She says her friends have all heard their partners fart and it’s weird she’s never heard me do it.
I can’t believe she saying I’m depressed looking while she’s such a shy girl and weird thinking she’s not.
So delusional.
I hate it, but they are my only friends.
She’s calling me cringe without a reason...
My friends are mean and delusional.
One is immature and shy and always pulling me down.
The other is fine, just jealous, and it’s getting on my nerves.
What to do?
This is a setup I can live with.
My boyfriend’s and my fear however is that in a few years when we’re ready to settle down, Gina will be wanting to move in and be long term with her own boyfriend.
I’m very stuck.
I love my boyfriend and desperately want to keep his system happy.
But I am not going to allow any more pushing of the boundaries.
What do I do here?
Boundary Issues with my boyfriend’s alter.
She was super keen for a second date and we arranged a location but not a date, due to the Christmas holidays.
I appreciate it’s a busy period for people, so our responses were like 1 per day.
She was up-front when we met and said she’s shit at texting, and has apologised when we were speaking for slow replies, something to which I said “don’t worry, I know you’re busy!”
The conversation seems to flow well, lots of questions from her side in the conversation.
However, I’ve not received a response for 3 days (unread), but she’s viewed my story and posted a story since.
It was New Year’s Eve.
So I was all ready for the New Year actually thinking positive and the changes I’m going to make, etc.
Then I see he’s posted a picture of them both that she’s taken saying “love of my life”.
It destroyed me.
He also put a status about 2022 being a special one.
Talk about rubbing it in my face!
Ex’s boyfriend posted a picture of them :-(
Every time I ask other people for advice on this situation, they all tell me that she’s probably insecure and looks up to me (even though she’s older, what the fuck?) and that I shouldn’t blame her for the way she feels.
I cannot deal with her.
She drains the life out of me.
I cannot talk about anything without her either trying to copy me or compete with me.
Recently I’ve been losing weight, and our family members noticed and commented on it.
In the corner of my eye, I could see her getting uncomfortable and then obviously she brought herself up and started talking about her accomplishments.
We agree to separate as our marriage was hitting a nose dive in general.
2 months later, we get back together.
We do intensive therapy and things seem to be great.
I’m so happy.
In our anniversary month, what do I see on his phone Snapchat?
I look at it again, I see Jane, but this time I can look at their conversation history throughout this whole year and last.
So I just got my first bearded dragon.
He’s only a month old, and like most new owners, I’m worried about if he or she is not eating enough.
I try to feed him in periods throughout the day, but so far I’ve only been able to feed him about 6-7 crickets.
I’ve tried feeding him some vegetables too, but the guy doesn’t show any interest in them.
Is there anything I’m doing wrong or is he just fine and I’m overly worried?
Then I found out about this really cool website called Complex.
They’re sort of like journalism but better, since they’re all about hip hop.
I found out about Travis Scott through Complex.
Before, I listened to trash artists with no aesthetic, but Travis Scott made me realize that aesthetic is really important.
Now I like Tame Impala, and I’ve started dressing weirder, I bought my first pair of joggers last week and hopefully I’ll wear them soon.
Is it just me cringing at the Twitter posts by Albatross?
Everyone who knows who he is knows his stance.
He’s making it seem like XVG is a sinking ship at the moment, and it’s doing fine.
So I have this friend in real life.
Man, the dude is known everywhere.
He’s got a solid reputation on the streets, in the jails. Everywhere this guy goes, everyone knows him.
He was trying to explain to me how to get more karma on Reddit, because I feel like I’m not really known.
How do you get hella karma?
I’m 21, he’s about to be 23.
My issue is that he seems to have no ambition anymore.
He doesn’t work and doesn’t make an effort to finish school, even small trade schools for a certification as an EMT.
He failed it the first time by 2 points, and I think he fears failure so he doesn’t really want to try anything anymore.
He’s been unemployed for over a year now and failed that school almost a year ago.
I’ve gotten Super Smough about 5 times, but I always get stuck in his nuclear butt bomb aura.
I swear I’m far enough away, but it still shocks me in 1 hit.
I’m using a 2H battle axe +10 gargoyle helms and naked (even with tattered armor it doesn’t seem to make a difference) Chloranthy ring and ring of steel protection.
Any tips?
I know by throwing myself at them enough times I’ll get them, but it’s slowly wearing at my sanity.
I know what to do, but I seem to always get caught in a dumb combination or something.
I bet you didn’t bother reading the whole number, or notice the letter I put in there, and now you’ll go back to check only to realize there was no letter.
What I if also told you you read this sentence wrong too?
Well, now that I have your attention!
I hope you’ll carefully read through the rest of this post :-)
19/F Aw shit, here we go again for the 7754378435116th time.
If I just want to make Draven my 1 carry, how should I do it?
I know he’s a good unit, but what items can turn him into a god?
I tried healing sword and rapid fire cannon, but I get lost after that.
Atlus is a great character.
However, his shield’s gun is overpowered and his rewind ability is somewhat annoying.
However the most annoying thing is his shield.
If you place down the shield and just use it to stop bullets that’s fine.
However I was playing as Skye today and threw my ult at his shield.
It did not activate, because it got absorbed.
I don’t know about other players’ opinions, but I believe that Atlus should be nerfed a good bit so he’s not overpowered enough to counter everything.
Tell me what you people think.
I didn’t think anything of it, so when I went to give the last cookies on the shelf to him, the entitled kid started screaming “Mommy, he stole my cookies!”
At first I was startled.
I started to get nervous, and I froze.
Then entitled parent walks up and starts yelling “Give those cookies back to my daughter! Give them back!”
And I did not know what to say at first, but then something came to mind: just say “but I didn’t.”
But the way I said it was so cautious.
Then my sister takes the cookies from my hands and handed them to my dad.
That’s when my dad noticed (he’s old — sad he didn’t realise a little bit earlier)
He called a manager to the scene, and the manager told us to continue and he’ll deal with it.
We broke up 2 months ago.
We had very little contact.
But tomorrow I’m no longer putting up with it.
He would be the one to reach out all the time.
I never reached out first.
And if I answered, it was only about the class he was paying me to do.
He is still on my car insurance, and he messaged me on Friend asking what was going on with it.
I answered the next day and said I didn’t change anything.
After that part of the conversation ended, I asked him how he was doing about the death of his dog.
(He is deployed and his dog was his world)
He said that he’s good when he doesn’t think about it and how he told his mom to cremate him, etc.
Day 1 of no contact starts tomorrow.
Help.
So me and a friend ended up making a poster.
We used my name and I’ll credit his Instagram below.
He’s a good guy.
I’m glad we got both our ideas in the poster for the game and our story.
Would you guys like either homemade lore or not?
I couldn’t post this on the Fallout Reddit for some reason.
It wouldn’t let me put the photo.
I hope it’s good, guys!
Is it even possible for ITSOKTOCRY to blow up outside of the 3 songs he’s had do extremely well?
Like get burst into the mainstream rather than just have a few albums do well then fall off?
Me and my friend have been playing Minecraft together for a while, and they made their own server so we can play on it together alone, cool.
I have always told my friend how much I despise griefers, because they don’t just destroy something in a game, they destroy hours of work, and it fucking sucks.
My friend lately has been really mean to me when we are playing, constantly saying I’m mean if I don’t go half way across the map to give him material that can be easily obtained where he is, literally repeating to me non-stop how I’m “mean” or a “bad person”, because I’m busy doing something so I can’t go give him his shit.
Well, I finally get a chance to let loose and have a wine date with a childhood friend of mine that I don’t see often at all.
We drink (at my house) while the kids are playing and such.
Nothing heavy.
We do get slightly tipsy, you know.
Towards the end, my husband sends me a Facebook message saying he’s ready for her to leave (she’d been there 2 hours at this point) and then he starts passive-aggressive cleaning in front of us.
He’s going through a divorce so he keeps telling me that’s taking all his money.
I didn’t give him a title as I didn’t even get one when I bought it.
It was salvaged from some guys at a used car lot.
They gave me a bill of sale, but I’ve long since lost it.
Should take him to court or do you think it’s not worth it?
Also, if I did want to how, would I?
So I just told this guy in my class, who was also weird as fuck and gave it to him saying “oof, I sat on it. It broke. Do you just want it?”
He’s like “no, ew”.
I have OCD and immediately got ashamed and was like “lol, why’s it gross?
It’s the same as a whole one (and along that line), like, lol, why?”, and he was like “ok, oof, it’s not” and I’m like “lol, why did you say that?”
I was saying it jokingly, but I’m afraid I looked weird.
Like what the fuck?
Why’s she upset or playfully upset that I don’t want it.
My human staff comes home tasting of sausages and cheese.
I think she has another fluff she is making treats for.
Should I be sad or angry?
What does your human taste of when they come home?
I can tell where your human has been and what they do by taste when they come back?
Hey guys, I just wanted to share this helpful application with you all :-D.
It’s not that I am trying to promote this application or something.
It really helped me a lot.
That’s why I thought it might even help you guys out.
I’ve seen quite a lot of people struggling to increase their team OVRs, and many are thinking to buy players, but can’t decide which will boost their team OVRs the most.
This application helps to calculate the OVR of your team after filling all the players in their respective positions.
It is really tough for most people (F2P players) to keep on buying and selling players to decide our team OVR since it will result in a huge loss of coins (because of 10% EA tax).
What’s the recommended amount of dedicated RAM I should have to server?
If you are reading this, you should be ashamed of yourself.
You should be asleep.
Go to bed, I say.
Once upon a time, there was a girl named Star Butterfly.
She had blond hair, blue eyes and a super cute and colorful dress.
And she had a magic wand!
One day she got kicked out of Mewny (her home dimension) by her mean mom >:-( just because she made a mistake.
So she had to go to Earth.
On Earth, there was a boy named Marco Diaz.
He liked safety and he was super handsome.
Everybody at school was in love with him!
(Except for that idiot Jackie)
So anyway, Star came to the principal’s office.
He was like “Star, this is Marco. He’s your guide.”
Star looked at Marco and she was shocked.
“Wow, you’re so hot.”
“lol, thank you” he said, blushing, and he winked.
“Let me show you around the school.”
“Ok”, said Star.
So they walked around school and they became friends.
“Ok, since you’re my best friend now, I should probably tell you who I am”, said Star.
“I’m a magic princess”.
Then she took out her wand and created 667 laser puppies!
I have a question for this Reddit.
Can you provide honest answers?
I currently have a custom build PC with i7 3770k 32g@1666 RAM and single GTX 1080 GPU.
Should I get a second one for 650 euros or wait for what upcoming years will bring?
GTX 1080 SLI or save money for 11th generation Nvidia xx80 TI GPU?
I know a lot about Jailbreak.
Should I make a Jailbreak?
How many likes can a thoughtless post get as long as I like Telecaster? :l.
If you don’t upvote post you hate Telecasters and should die.
Thanks, ok.
I love Telecasters.
We should rename August to October, because he wasn’t released in August.
I bought GTA4 for Steam PC and it won’t work.
It worked fine for a small year on Windows 7, and now my PC has Windows 10 and it won’t work.
I made Social Club and Games for Windows Live accounts, but it won’t work even with accounts.
It won’t work even for single player.
It won’t work after the people on screen wait in the loading screen.
Then suddenly when the game should start, it just closes the window and that’s it.
So how make it work ?
How do we get them to know they should use it?
The only feasible situation I see is a complete and big economic collapse...
I want to use it, because I want to control my own destiny and not be robbed by the central banks or the government and I want to feel my own liberty.
I do not have even $1 in my bank account, because I don’t want to own debt tokens.
I want to own freedom...
How do we change the landscape?
What are your thoughts?
Sorry for my English being bad.
I should buy up that limited time bike for Halloween before it disappears next week.
Inside your body, deep beneath your skin, muscles, and not beneath your organs, lurks 1 (one) skeleton.
Spooky!
But wait, it gets worse.
The skeleton inside you doesn’t even pay rent!
He/she lives in your body so he/she should pay rent!
They freeload off you and don’t even do shit for you.
So you should evict your spooky boy.
Happy Halloween!
Edit: I didn’t expect this post to blow up like it has!
Thanks for the 6 upvotes!
Just small information, I’m 5’9 140lbs male.
Currently, my 5k is 1:58.7 and my 2k is a 1:51.1
My coach says I should be 1:49 for a 2k, but I really can’t hold a 1:49 for more than 1200 meters before my split just rises to 2:05-2:10.
Is 1:49 just my coach being a typical “you should be good, but you’re not, so I’m going to give you unrealistic goals”, or should I be at 1:49?
My head hurts when I go krumping heads with other boys!
Green lighting things go all over the place too!
What should I do, doctors?!
Right, so I’ve fixed my headaches!
I’ve had to throw up some burny green stuff!
The boss says I should do that more on the battle, the place we’ve been fighting in!
I’ve got a metal stick for my trouble too!
This poem went as follows:
> My name is frog,
> I like to play,
> Out in the rain,
> All night and day.
> My skin is green,
> My face is coy,
> You look and say,
> Here comes that boy.
This was received rather poorly, earning me some disapproving comments.
Aren’t you all tired of seeing at least the first two jumping into battle and wiping out your whole team in an instant?
I’ve heard somewhere about people saying that if they weren’t here then, well, the game would be balanced.
Well, I beg to differ, because there’s Akai with his insane disruption and Diggie with his timely ult or maybe even Irithel might be banned because of her deadly ability to snowball and splash ult.
Back to the topic.
Honestly, the king and queen of this game are Lancelot and his beloved Fanny.
You know, to keep it safe from me in little car where I can go anywhere.
And then Mom-O decides to go to the gym to do a quick workout, whatever that is.
She says to me, “You leave the steak alone, doggo. You be a good girl!”
She tied a plastic bag real tight around the steak.
Haha!
Then she goes into the gym, and when she come back many forevers later, guess what?
Haha!
She opens the tiny car and looks at me and looks at the steak bag… and she says, “Good Girl!
You left the steak alone!”
And that is the story of me being a good girl.
Mom-O says she should have brought the steak into the gym and left it on the bench next to her with her sweatshirt.
She says she is dumb not to think of that.
Maybe Mom-O will get smart in a few forevers.
My bed smells like disease.
I should probably wash it.
Please send me some tips and stuff on what to teach him.
Currently he’s doing pretty good, though the only thing he buys is shotguns, because that’s the only gun he gets kills from.
I already taught him the basics like planting the spike and things like that.
By the way, this is coming from an Iron 3 player (hardstuck, friends say I should be silver and some even say platinum, because I carried a gold player).
Do you know how some motherfuckers exist?
They literally get close to you, then all of a sudden you have problems, and even though you apologize again and again and again, no it’s never enough for them.
I was in a Google Meet, but I told them I’d be back in 10.
I forgot my phone so I went to get it, and guess what, them speaking about you and backstabbing you.
You seriously don’t know what to do and whom to trust anymore.
Maybe I am overthinking, but I’d rather die alone than live among these kind of people.
Maybe I should just ignore them?
Or should I give them another chance?
Or maybe I am just weird, lol.
l have developed feelings for my best friend.
Now, the question is: should l tell her how l feel about her?
Will this affect our relationship that we have?
How will she take it?
I’ve been waiting for two years now, savings from then and I barely made 200 USD until now.
I’m still studying, and gaming is my dream… and these prices are giving me depression and hopelessness from life… to be honest…
What should I get?
A monitor or a GPU…?
Some of you are so lucky to get a GPU for free on here… lol…
Am I the asshole? Me (31F) asked my kids dad (43M) to help me finish off stripping wallpaper in the kids’ room so I can finish decorating it.
I recently had surgery and am not meant to lift too much or stretch but felt OK and thought I could do it alone.
I can’t.
I hurt my incisions so asked him to help do the top of the walls where I can’t reach.
He said yes and today came to do it.
After a bit, he said he was done and leaving.
I gave him £20 and said how grateful I am for the help.
I checked the room once he left...
Both kids’ beds were full of torn off wallpaper, drawers cracked where he stood on them.
I’ve still 2 walls left unfinished and have spent the last 45 minutes picking up wallpaper from everything.
His kids sleep on these beds.
Am I the asshole if I confront him about the mess or should I let it go and not bother asking in future?
My boyfriend gets impatient easily and gets annoyed when I ask dumb questions (for example, I didn’t know how to fill my tire and he got annoyed after he explained it once and then said “why is it hard? Just fill it”.
So I tried to do it but I failed.
Later he was like “babe… it took you an hour to fill your tire?”
Then when I do it myself and don’t ask him he goes “why don’t you ask me? I can teach you or help you”, but I refrain from asking, because he gets frustrated.
The last couple of calls had arguments, as he got mad, because I beat his ass in video games (even though gaming is his only hobby) and I’ve left wondering if our relationship is worth the trouble.
I’ve talked about him to lots of my real life friends, and they all ask why I continue to be his friend, and I can never confidently answer why.
But he’s depressed and lonely and wants my attention as I’m one of the only people who actively tries to interact with him online.
Yeah I know, my shoes don’t match.
They match the graffiti though!
I’m trying a lot of different styles, so let me know what I should change.
Hat: Sicko by Ian Conner
Shoes: Nike
Everything else is thrifted.
Ok, so I swallowed a small piece of box (?) tape as I was trying to bite it off with my teeth, and then I feel it in my ear 😭 not ear but that hole in my throat that leads to the ear. It’s just stuck there, oh my God 😭😭😭
What should I do, lol?
She had me live with a woman once named Chi who said similar stuff, and … it’s just dude what…? Heck, it’s weird.
So maybe it’s both a sort of a paradox (life is), but I just want to know, honestly, did anyone else feel it?
I want a logical explanation please, and if one doesn’t exist, well I mean, because long before… I was “of age” so to speak… for lack of more efficient words that would be appropriate, because I don’t drink, but I’ve…hmm… I’m an adult, let’s put it like that.
There’s other stuff out there, but long before that, me and my family saw a UFO.
Even my stepdad said he couldn’t think of what else it could’ve been, and me and my friends saw this white hooded thing in a park about 10 feet tall and, like… it doesn’t really scare me, because I think it’s the way life is.
Things change.
They don’t always have to make sense, and others say that too.
Here is an example of two paragraphs written in the alternate spelling system and then in regular spelling:
> The North Wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stronger, when a traveller came along wrapped in a warm cloak.
They agreed that the one who first succeeded in making the traveller take his cloak off should be considered stronger than the other.
Then the North Wind blew as hard as he could, but the more he blew the more closely did the traveller fold his cloak around him; and at last the North Wind gave up the attempt.
Then the Sun shined out warmly, and immediately the traveller took off his cloak.
And so the North Wind was obliged to confer that the Sun was the stronger of the two.
> That quick beige fox jumped in the air over each thin dog under a calm autumn moon.
Look out, I shout, for he’s foiled you yet again, creating chaos.
Who would win?
Please give a detailed explanation.
Ares (Greek mythology) vs. Mars (Roman mythology) vs. Svetovid (Slavic mythology) vs. Odin (Norse mythology) vs. The Big Bang (Atheistic mythology).
I am very ready.
I am very good.
I would like to apply for village idiot.
Should I get Horizon Zero Dawn or ELEX, because they are the same price right now, so what should I buy?
I’m just looking for reason.
By the way, I like open world a lot and shooters, e.g. Skyrim, Battlefield, COD, Ark Survival Evolved.
So any ideas on what I should be?
By the way, I would prefer them really quick.
Thanks in advance.
Thanks for the suggestions guys.
We are going to try to get the AK-477, because someone said it would help, but where do we find it?!
Please help with it.
We can’t do it alone :-)
I reside in Hyderabad, India, currently pursuing my Bachelor’s in computer science.
I am a Canadian citizen, but for enrolment it is required to appear for the IELTS exam.
Now, the doubt that has arisen is… would my admission be considered international or domestic?
On a side note, how hard is it to be admitted to UoT’s computer science program?
What would a typical admitted applicant have to get admitted?
I would prefer a hardcore clan with a plan. With a strict mentality of how certain things would go down.
I mean a clan that always has a goal or target, that also enjoy teamplay.
It’s not a necessity, but it would be nice.
PM me if you’re interested!
By the way, it’s my first post on this subreddit, so I might not have gotten it all down correct.
I’ve literally heard people tell me they learnt then forgot the entire Japanese language through anime.
I live in a house with a single mother whose first language is Thai and I barely heard English until I was like 4.
She would speak in Thai to me yet I don’t know any Thai.
You can’t learn Japanese though anime.
In fact I watched anime in Thai dubbed as a child.
I don’t fucking know shit.
Fools thinking they are out here saying “konnichiwa” in style, I’m contacting the authorities.
Here’s a question for you.
So you know the Panzer, Blue Gitz, the Tau or whatever?
So I, being a Mek, notice that they’ve got tanks and stuff that are flying, right, but they’ve not go the flames coming from whatever thrusters keep them in the air.
And they don’t make the beautiful roar that thrusters make.
I figure some commando would want a flying truck that doesn’t make a noise.
It’s a good market strategy.
Anyway, the question: “how do I krump gravity without a sound?”
Construction: teleport to house, for when they work on making player-owned houses useful, this would be godly to have.
Heck! Even now, player-owned houses has a permanent dummy for adrenaline building, prayer altar, and if they make it like Old School RuneScape, where you can teleport outside any player-owned house portal, this cape would be used a lot.
Hitpoints: Heal from regeneration ability increased, current perk I doubt would be used at either bossing or slayer.
This one is used at slayer at least.
I got one of my annual minds.com token ads in my mail today (I of course unsubscribed as soon as I found the option) and thought “hey, what the heck, let’s make a visit on the supposedly “alternative Facebook” that I just recently got denied for having a “non-believable name” and waiting further ID specification before I can use it again.”
And so I did and found out on the 2nd or 3rd post that The AJ Show has been blocked on YouTube,
I’m not a fan of rightwing stuff and was actually the reason I stopped watching it 2 years ago, though the small fragrance of freedom was that hard to find among the 90% national-capitalism the site has to offer, but anyhow, I got the idea of a non-censoring video site like LiveLeak but much more simple and less “newsy” that anyone can post on. No content would be removed ❤️
Hi guys.
I’m at 1500 hours right now, and my instructor still doesn’t let me solo.
I think I’m doing my manoeuvres ok, but the instructor says I still need more practice. I’ve tried my manoeuvres on a flight simulator, and my friend captain says that I should stop sending him videos of me playing GTA on my computer at 1 in the morning, although I trained hard on my flight manoeuvres.
What should I do?
I’m literally crying and shaking right now.
My friend would never do that :-(
Why don’t they make like Sesame Street for the kids, yo?
Like, it is very educational, I think kids would learn a lot from it.
I’m kind of hoping to find a place that doesn’t charge those exorbitant commission and all the extras.
I have some questions and hope someone can help answer.
1. I saw some ads on Shooroq... no commission, etc.
Are there any hidden costs I need to be vary about?
2. Is there enough parking for the second car?
3. How much would the DEWA charges for a 1BHK come to?
4. Any other areas I should look for in Dubai that has reasonable rent ?
It’s a bit unnerving to manage expenses on 1 person’s salary in this place...
I appreciate any advice I get.
Bones says something like “switchblade on my waist don’t test”, and it was old young teenage bones, and the beat was hella mellow.
I would really appreciate this.
Finally it’s giving me an internet connection, but the only problem is, it’s so slow.
It’s capable of loading like Google, but anything else just times out.
And for some reason I can’t access my router admin page.
Really weird.
It’s just a white screen or it times out loading it, or the page becomes unresponsive!
Help would be appreciated, thank you!
Hey all, so today I was in the group chat with friends, and like four of them were roasting the fuck out of me, and at first it was funny, then my ego and self-respect got crippled after building it up for a couple days.
Haha, fun.
Yes, I know I am lonely and won’t get a girlfriend, but you don’t need to be jerk like that, haha.
Hi there, it’s good to see you again!
*sits down*
How have you been?
*cuts a potato with my sacrificial dagger*
Wow, that’s great to hear.
*adds 12kg of salt*
Hm, there we go.
*throws a handful over my left shoulder for the devil*
Ok good, let’s eat.
*removes a small flask from my jacket and pours blood from it onto my plate in a small thick puddle*
Haha, that’s the good stuff right there.
*chomp chomp*
Do you want some? No?
Ok good *eats a spoonful of salt*
Oh! This is crunchy.
*chews and spits out bones*
Huh *licks lips*
Welp, that was wonderful, I’m pooped.
*gets up*
Thanks for having me over!
*transforms into a bat and flies away*
I’m feeling sad, but it’s okay I guess. Because medicines will help help us all.
Thank you, have a good morning and good night and good evening Truman show, haha.
Just kidding.
It’s going to be just as shitty if not worse than last year.
All these skin mods and such, how’s it being done?
I’d like to try it.
Is it player-side only?
Mods? How are people modding Battlefront 2 or is it Photoshop?
Hi, I was wondering whether or not it is worth dropping some money on pets.
Like, I saw how much some people can spend on them to get good results (like T4), and I wouldn’t want to spend that much :-D.
Currently, I have 5 T1 pets, and I wouldn’t mind seeing some increase in their looting speed, but I wonder if dropping “just” $100 would be worth it.
Is it worth dropping $100 on pets?
Towards the end of senior year and that summer, I don’t know what happened, but I got a hot body and my face was all “girl, you’ve been through some shit. Have a gift”, so now I’m pretty.
I just made a post on a different subreddit about having a nice date today, which is nice, but I am very hesitant on making friends and stuff because of the last two years.
So like, after my glow up or whatever, more people started talking to me, yeah.
And a lot of boys did too!
I never really had very many friends, so this was a huge yay!
The first boy I hung out with was really nice, but then we got high and I did very regrettable things I do not like.
Well, that boy was super happy and told lots of boys.
I don’t want to jinx it and call them out by name, but I’m talking with a company and I’m hoping it works out!
I’m excited about all things I’ll be able to do with these free promo products to help other people and possibly get them off some or all of their Rx drugs!
I’m excited for myself, because I have a bunch of medical issues that I do not use Rx drugs for and the other stuff I buy is expensive.
This sponsorship will help me, it will help me help others, and it will help this company as well.
I’m ready, I’m ready!
I’m hella excited!
I might be picking up a new sponsor!
I will be posting more here once I get… comfortable again.
(Self-love is important!)
I’m on and off though, and have quite a bit of messages to go through - will get to them when I can :-)
In the meantime, Happy New Year!
P.S. I don’t have a Snapchat and don’t take any money, I just like to show off, you know, closet slut things :-) lol
Talk to you later, everyone!
He said “shh, just kiss me you fool”.
I still love him and I cried so much on Valentine’s weekend (don’t judge, lmao), but I said “No. You’re fucked up now.
What’s going on?”
He never replied to me afterwards, and this interaction took about 10 minutes through text.
Today he says “good lord, what the fuck happened?
I’ve got to garden.
Talk to you later”.
He read my reply, which said “I’m so worried about you!
Why would you take that?
Where did you find it, and why would you take it?
Eat and stay hydrated”.
I just don’t know anymore.
I suspected it, but I want him to be upfront about it with me.
I love him, and he will always be my first, and I’ll always talk to him and care for him, but I don’t want to be held in limbo.
I’m trying to move on and this is now in my head.
I know whenever I say “talk to you later” or “good night” or whatever I want to add an “I love you”. Just casually. To see what happens.
I know that every time I get a text from them I get super excited.
I know when I am having a bad day, just thinking of them makes me feel so much better.
Just knowing I can go home and text them brightens my mood ten-fold.
I know sometimes I daydream about just holding them and being near them.
But what I don’t know is what this means.
I’ve known them nearly four months now.
That’s not long.
It makes me feel like this is an infatuation that will pass.
To be honest, I kind of hope it is, because I don’t think it’s mutual.
But oof, is it hitting me hard!
Is it merely infatuation?
Their explanation is that they’re a bad texter, or busy, but honestly so am I (I will takes days or a week to respond), but I don’t leave people on read or open messages I know I can’t respond to at the moment.
It really isn’t that hard to send a quick “talk to you later” either to be honest.
Finally they seem to want to engage with me and basically tell me they’re going to an event and they’d hope to see me there, which they reaffirm the next day and then on the day.
I go to event, they never show.
At this point I’m too stressed from a lot of other shit I got going on, and it’s not like we’re really talking, so I just block them.
I don’t know, I need to change my mindset or this and that for my benefit and survival.
I’m still “Ocean Serene”, but maybe I’m... I don’t know, that’s a tough thing to say, I never thought that my girlfriend was just a random.
I love her to death, she is my boo and will always be it.
Just like I said a lot of things, I’m gonna agree that if I change, the world changes.
The advice you get, it’s always iffy.
I want to speak for everyone, but at the same time I can only speak for myself.
Also, I went to get some rum and coke.
I got coke and a few other people saw it, so they bought some coke… erm, I hope my friends are ok (that’s all you weirdos I’m talking about).
Random story I know.
To be honest, I’m not ok, but I’m surviving like usual.
Actually I’m all just a bit right and fine. Talk to you later.
Talk to you later.
[bro] Across the country?
She acts like 500 miles is a long way.
[me] lol, it’s 8 hours to [redacted], 7 to [redacted].
Not a big deal.
[bro] I suppose when you don’t maintain your vehicles, an hour’s drive could be detrimental.
[me] lol
[me] I suppose [redacted] or [redacted]’s wife ratted me out.
Maybe I should block them too.
[bro] Sorry for her awkward messages.
I was in the middle of a drunk nap when she pulled up to my house, and I told her you jumped ship.
Told her not to try to contact you, and we can see how well that went.
[me] Shit. Betrayal.
[bro] I’m sure she’s contacting you for her own self-gratification.
I was in a toxic relationship for 4 months.
During our dating period and a month or so into our relationship, we were great.
One day, both of us were jealous of each other for no reason.
I’m going to admit that sometimes when I feel jealous, I just want her to reassure me like how I reassure her that it’s all good, but she will only reassure me once and then said “bye” or “talk to you later”.
Most of the time in an argument, it’s always my fault.
She won’t admit to anything or say sorry.
I will always be the one to give in so that the fight won’t continue anymore.
And I said “But yeah yeah, you’re right.”
And he said “Yeah, well I’ve got to go. I’m doing something”, and I was going to type “alright, talk to you later”, but I realized we aren’t at that level anymore.
I didn’t like that.
The vibe was going good.
I didn’t have a bad vibe. When the conversation started.
But once he said he’s doing something, my heart dropped.
Like, what was he doing?
He’s never done this before.
This was such a different person.
I hate it.
What can I do?
All these attempts I made were basically shut down.
I like him, but I’m not trying to flirt or do anything!
I know he doens’t like me like that.
We talked about it.
Right now, I’m just chatting with him.
But he doesn’t seem like he wants to do that.
If he doesn’t want to talk to me, he can just fucking tell me.
I don’t know what else to put besides that I hate the current circumstance of  life I live in.
I’m going to give a little insight tomorrow.
Ok, I lied.
I have to reveal my age tomorrow, because if I don’t, it’ll mess up the story.
Um, I don’t know what to type so I’ll type a worry I have.
Um, I don’t think I’ll get the tape gun in time.
Ok bye, talk to you later everyone.
She said something like “but I want to make sure that we go as a friend?” thing and I was like “okay, I know”, and sometimes she talks about her relationship and she said “of course I like my long time boyfriend”.
Yeah, whatever, right, haha.
And here’s my question...
Yesterday when I was at work, she messaged me saying something like “how’s your work doing?”, and I kind of replied to her with a cold tone saying “I’m at work, talk to you later”, and then she, kind of upset: “Okay, I mean I understand you are at work so busy, but you didn’t cut me off like this before; so I kind of get it that you don’t want to talk anymore like before.
Got it!
Bye!”
And my machine fucking freezes up.
It’s been happening for like 2 days now...
This machine can run a goddamn $26,000 3D scanner, but 4 browser tabs on Reddit and new a chat session uses up 87% of my damn memory and 60% of my CPU power and freezes the whole damn thing up.
Hey! Wait!
I’ve got a new complaint! Seriously, what the fuck are you developers doing?
Stop, please!
If you think it’s rude to just walk away in the middle of a conversation without excusing yourself, or at least saying “got to go, I’ll talk to you later”, then it’s also rude when texting.
I could let it go if it was a one-off.
Things happen.
Maybe something came up and you got distracted, etc.
But every single person ghosts in the middle of a conversation.
It’s really not that hard to just say “got to go, I’ll text you later” or “so-and-so just got home, talk to you later”.
Even just “bye” or “be right back” or something!
Today I got mad and just flat out asked him to tell me where the problem was and if I did something wrong.
He said he was with his friends and he didn’t want to ignore them just to talk to me.
I said it wouldn’t be a problem if he had just said something like “I can’t talk right now” or “I’m with my friends, talk to you later” or just literally anything.
He then said I was overthinking stuff and I should “chill out”, so I left it at that.
So am I the asshole and overthinking things?
Am I the asshole for getting mad at my boyfriend after he ignored me for a few days?
So I would usually post this on r/keto, but that subreddit is so intense about their keto.
And I respect it.
But, like, a girl’s got to rant.
I started keto a few weeks ago.
I have been doing well, and I feel like I’ve lost weight.
Out of nowhere, I get slammed with cravings.
My body is like “bitch, calories please”.
I oh so badly want to make it to my goal weight and flock around on a beach in a bathing suit, and I also want to honor the tenacity that r/keto so proudly espouses in their “no cheat days” mantra.
But, alas, another side of me wants to curl up in my bed with my favorite gluten-free dairy-free carbohydrate dense carrot cake and go to satiety land.
As far I as I know, the concept of mini-album is only around in K-pop (maybe I-pop?).
I’m always disappointed when a long-awaited comeback or something is only some 4 or 5-song album.
I can tolerate a debut album, since you really don’t have a lot of material, but if you’re SNSD or something and you come out with mini after a years long hiatus like Mr.Mr, it’s kind of insulting.
I don’t know what to say, lol.
I’m pretty funny, not only because I manage to trip over air and choke on my own saliva far too often, but also because I’m just fucking hilarious to be honest.
I’m from Yorkshire, and that probably makes me cooler than you, because the North is just superior, and I’m ready to die on this hill, but I guess we can be mates.
I would really like some of those.
Ok, I’m running out of people to laugh at my jokes.
17M from the UK,
Please be able to hold a conversation, lol.
I don’t know what kind of dog this was, but it was so ugly.
My god, who would own such a thing?
Dogs with wrinkles like Pugs, Shar Peis (I don’t know how to spell it), Bulldogs, Boxers, any dog with those ugly ass wrinkles are so dumb.
I’m not a dog hater at all; I love dogs.
But the breeds that I mentioned are so fucking ugly and gross they shouldn’t be owned, and I’ve literally been told these kinds of dogs need surgery just to live a proper life.
(Wrinkles over eyes cause blindness and over the nose, they can’t breathe)
And yes, I know I’m going to get shit on by all the fucking neckbeards on Reddit that just adore their snot nose little Pug.
I don’t even care.
I’m so tired of people and their dogs.
Are boobs nice? Because, I don’t know, I’ve never seen them before.
Then he checks the oil level, saying that the oil also smells like gasoline, that gasoline and oil are mixing up together.
He opens one spark plug, sees the massive leak in there literally full up.
Let me say, oil smells like gasoline.
I didn’t smell that one.
That’s what the worker told me.
Then he call his boss, and the boss says it is not gasoline, it is just oil, “that shit smells like gasoline” 🤦🏾‍♂️
Even the worker confirmed that I’m not crazy, but ay, maybe I am.
And his worker told me he was going to seal the black thing that goes on top of the spark plug that covers it.
Sorry, my English is not that amazing.
He said he was putting a seal after draining the oil as he mentioned.
As oil drained, the oil sealed the thing so oil doesn’t drip out of it and doesn’t drip to the floor.
But it didn’t help me find the cause of why oil is getting into the spark plug, because a seal on the coil plug ignition 🤦🏾‍♂️
He tells me if the problem keeps on, it is maybe my oil catch can that is sending way too much oil and is causing the oil leak, that if the problems persist I will have to remove it.
Sorry for the long paragraph, but I need advice.
I need help to be honest.
My rabbit didn’t eat or drink, so I went to check him.
It’s been now 4 or 5 hours and I saw him now drink and eat a little bit.
I have to give him medicines and the thing which is like food, I don’t know.
(He has constipation so I’m going to check if he poops.)
How do I sleep if I have to check on my rabbit?
My sleep schedule is going to become chaotic, lol.
I assume the time has already passed for this, but, I don’t know, I figured I may as well ask.
I kind of forgot I even had those tickets until they announced they’d be touring again today.
Now, my aunts (grandma’s sisters) are telling me I should not give her half of the money due to the way she treated grandma both before and after she passed.
When my grandma first started getting sick, my sister wasn’t the best, because she had just got a new boyfriend.
She didn’t reach out a lot to my grandma, and didn’t go to see her.
I would go out as much as possible, but grandma was also scared of Covid.
The month before she passed, I told my job I couldn’t come in and would drive the hour to her house and stay with her (back and forth sometimes).
I had finals going on at the same time, and had to figure out a place to live.
Would I be the asshole if I didn’t give my sister half of our inheritance?
So I met this girl like 2 weeks ago and we are dating.
Last night, everything was all right, she was happy said “good night” and “I love you” like every night.
And the next morning when I texted her good morning, she left me on seen and blocked me.
One of her friend said that she was sad as fuck all day because of me but didn’t want to say why.
I don’t know what I did.
I did nothing.
What should I do?
How can I contact her?
Should I give her space?
My girlfriend blocked me, and I don’t know why.
Mine’s ending and all my grades are passable except for biology in which I have an F.
This is because I made the mistake of turning things into her desk and not the bin, meaning I have like 4 or 5 assignments that I’ve done but are nowhere in the books,
This kind of snuck up on me, because I thought they were done and filed, only to check my grades and find out they weren’t.
Anybody else have this problem?
(if you are going to say “I know right, I only have an 89, why couldn’t she round up? Fuck my life)
I’m going to be honest, that’s not very helpful right now.
So first off, Bard top.
What a pick, I know right?
Let’s drop down my main build, because it’s the best assassin play style I like.
*my core is static/ie/RFC.
Now, I tried many ways, and this is the best way.
I like to safely clear and lay out poke.
Now under certain occasions like against a Garen, I’d go what many would call Shotgun Bard, swapping out static for Runaan’s and if needed rapid firecannon for Phantom Dancer.
Giving some more tank…
Now, as for the other two, I actually leave them more optional picks in the ability power department or in which case magic pen.
In this section is a few situations for more sustain.
I’d pick up Hextech Gunblade.
This item is phenomenal on Bard, and hits are great.
If you’re already carrying hard, I’d go something like Liandry’s, because with the lead, no one will catch you with this, and the chunk is just Bard crazy.
I’m tet to try Gunblade and Liandry’s together, but someday…
Hey guys, Bard main.
I just joined Reddit after finding out there are other off-meta Bards!
So I main him top.
Yes, it’s scary, but I do.
So I’ve been getting a lot of questions about my builds from friends and happy on-lookers lately!
I thought I’d share my builds!
I’m 16 years old, 5’9.
I’m new to basketball and I’d like to ask for drills I can do by myself so I can be good or even great at it.
I only have one basketball and half a court.
I don’t have a decent shot nor a decent handle,
I could barely reach the backboard plus I have no friends so don’t even ask how good my defense is.
The reason why I wanted to be good at it so bad is because I just want people to know me as somebody, because right now I’m a nobody,
I want to be somebody.
P.S. I’ve never played an actual basketball ever in my life… I know, right?
Hi guys, I’ve always had a lot of trouble making friends and consider myself kind of standoffish and awkward at times (that cancer rising, you know) but pretty chill once you get past that.
Super loyal and empathetic, pretty smart (when I want to be), goofy, a little chaotic, big overthinker kind of deal.
Enneagram type 4, because apparently that matters (just kidding!).
I’m honestly really looking for some truly kind, genuine people that might share some of my goals of breaking patterns and cycles, trying to be better, treating others with respect, dignity, and love... you get the gist :-)
I dream of becoming a psychiatrist, so a program with medical school prerequisites would be preferable.
Plus, I plan to take my medical school abroad (wow, big dreams much?
I doubt I’d get in, but it wouldn’t hurt to try though).
Academics aside, the community is also important to me.
I’d be even more motivated to study if my teachers are kind and if my classmates are easy to get along with.
Oh, and location too.
I’m short, so if my classes are far, I might as well rollerskate my way through campus, just kidding.
You set up a dramatic encounter, a dramatic fight, and then Ellie gets the upper hand.
Then, you give the player an option.
Do you kill Abby, or spare her?
That way, players can decide if they want to kill someone who now seems human, and someone they feel bad for, or shoot her ass and laugh as she dies, glad you avenged your former character.
Or, you know... Have Ellie kill Abby.
Seriously, doing this would’ve prevented so much backlash.
Easy, simple, you do the thing that the player was expected to do.
The player goes home somewhat fulfilled.
An opinion from someone who hasn’t played TLOU 1 or 2.
So basically, I kind of have a crush right now, but I don’t know if I want to pursue her.
It’s complicated.
Right now its summer break, so I’m going to wait until school starts again to try for real again.
I can actually talk to girls in person, because they don’t talk to me online, lol.
I don’t know how long this series will go, but I will try to post every day until it happens.
As of right now my confidence in finding a girlfriend is very low.
I don’t know how long this is going to take but probably quite a while.
All I want is for someone to love me for me and a girl that I can share my feelings with, since right now I don’t have a person to do that with.
I would like to take this moment to say that if you’re a kid, like an elementary school kid and you’re here, where the fuck are your parents?
lol, never mind, fuck them.
You are so much better than them.
Because I got them and no one to give them too, lmao, just kidding,  unless...
Anyone order 3 large fries, 1 medium Sprite and a McDouble?
Hey, hi!
Haha... I’m new here, I didn’t know this existed until now.
I am extremely shy and don’t know what I’m doing here typing this, haha.
But hey, first time for everything right?
If we don’t click and you lose interest, then please tell me, no ghosting please.
I will cry, lmao.
I don’t expect to get any messages, but hey, it’s worth a try.
P.S. I don’t know how to write these properly, so I tried to copy this one post I saw that was in a bullet format, oh my.
Oh and if I don’t reply soon, it might mean I’m asleep or playing DnD, hehe.
Never mind.
My internet is down right now.
Fuck.
Well I’m going to see if I can buy some stuff off Steam now...
Let’s hope there are still some good sales.
Okay, so I was a total noob and erased my seeds since I made a new wallet that I was going to use, but I sent Monero to that wallet instead of my new one.
I know the password but not the seeds.
Is it possible to retrieve your wallet?
Or how do you open the .key file?
Edit: never mind, I’m a complete noob.
I figured it out.
Possible to retrive Monero wallet seeds with a .keyfile?
user765123: No, I just had the “is now playing” thing show up.
A: I know.
A: Well, here we go.
A: “easily disturbed”, lol
A: Momma, help me.
A: Help me.
A: What’s the canon name?
user765123: ?
A: my name.
A: What’s the canon one?
user765123: There is none, pick whatever name you want.
A: Oh.
A: Am I a girl?
user765123: Male.
A: Argh.
<talking about their name here>
user765123: That seems like a good name.
user765123: lol
A: >:-)
user765123: (not that it really matters. I just used my real life name)
Comment
So I can guess your gender based on your post history.
Never mind… let me guess your gender instead.
So the deadline to drop a full year course with permission from the professor is October 18.
(Edit: never mind, this part isn’t true, please disregard).
The deadline to drop without receiving a grade is February 9.
Does this mean I still have to inform the professor that I’m dropping the course?
Do I also have to get permission?
I’m planning to take 2 other courses so I still take the same amount of credits by the way.
I just didn’t have the confidence to speak and tell jokes and stuff.
I was actually sweating at the presence of these other people.
I was avoiding eye contact and trying to face as far away from them as possible.
When I really wanted to speak to my friends, I’d quietly mumble a joke to them.
But one time, he didn’t hear it and so he was like “what?!” really loudly.
I felt my heart rate increase and started sweating more.
I would just say “never mind”, because I felt like I was in the motherfucking spotlight.
To be honest, has anyone ever experienced fighting a 2v1 or maybe a 3v1 against a tank that doesn’t die and manage to kill a least one of you?
Talking to that rampage and crunch, but rampage didn’t pop his ult yet.
😲 What the fuck?!
Now, again, what would paragon be without the current pressure hunter right now?
My guess is a team with growth totem with 2 tanks, a stun-or-not caster, a tanky as fuck fighter, and a carry that solos everything if he wants to.
When I turn off those 2 switches, it drops down to between .28- 2.1
When they are gone for 2 or 3 days at a time and we leave switches on, it stays down also.
I’m not positive, but I think the owners are aware and did it to cut corners.
However, there’s always the possibility that the man behind us did it.
So I’ve had enough.
I finally decided I’m done paying $300 electric bills so it can be 48 degrees in my house with no hot water.
So I know I’m really opening up a can of worms with my landlord, but it’s not legal and I shouldn’t have to pay someone else’s expenses, never mind the $6000+ that was destroyed simply by being plugged in...
Oh, and the part where I barely sleep at night at fear of burning down, and I won’t leave my dog home alone either in fear a fire will catch while I’m not home.
Like now I feel guilty for smiling.
Never mind the fake ones shit, but fuck.
Haha. Ugh.
Why am I still alive?
lol, why the fuck does smiling hurt?
Then I see a figure slowly walking towards my general direction, and I finally look up.
The moment I look up, Paul is looking straight at me, still walking towards me.
I don’t say anything or look back down, because, get this: he says the first he’s ever said to me in the sexiest, most hottest, attractive way possible.
He says “What’s up?” in this low, quieter voice but has the cutest but at the same time hottest smile ever.
I blow up inside and I smile back, not holding back my overjoyed emotions.
And I say “hi”, with the biggest smile I probably had.
I’m just praying to God now that I didn’t have nasty stuff in my teeth or that my face didn’t look disgusting.
But I look straight nail down at my food and pokerfacedely keep eating my food.
I do that for maybe 3 seconds.
Then I look back up.
Paul has just stated walking away, which means he was standing there looking at me or doing God knows what for 3 seconds.
Edit: Yes, I know.
Plants are important.
Oxygen. Useful, I know.
But ugh. They really could focus on something more entertaining like how poisons and toxins affect our body.
By the way, there some great documentaries about it T_T
Edit 2: never mind. I’ll just print the thing
I was playing normal, just got into an alliance. Oops, now I’m not getting any MP!
Try to type in chat, “I will not cheat on this game!”
The message repeats every time I hit enter.
What the fuck!
I’m not cheating.
Anyway, I type those words into the chat (“I will not cheat on this game!”) and it tells me to pay the server and turn off Adblock.
Worst way to tell a player to turn off Adblock, but whatever.
It tells me to turn off then refresh.
I do and lost my best game and restart as a new player.
10/10 I’m never playing again.
Edit: never mind, anytime I type in the chat, the same shit happens.
I’m going to skip the Oscar-bait shit like The Post, because there’s only some much concentrated rage at milquetoast Democrats making movies about how (extremely wonky nasal nerd voice) “politics used to be more polite. We need a return to the discourse.”
I’m sure I forgot a couple.
Will he be so much better that he’s worth more than Kinlaw and the player(s) that we pick from the extra picks we get?
OT could be there like Thomas, but I’m just not convinced any guy we take will be better than Little entering his 2nd year.
He has health concerns at the moment, but we also have Daley entering his 2nd year and is a decent safety net.
Interior offensive line I think is a major problem, but there is no Nelson-like prospects that are going in the top 10.
Edge might be a need depending on FA, and the Iowa guy (I cannot spell his name) is good, but that’s still a bit of a reach.
If we do not resign Bradberry and Okudah is there, that’s really the only situation where I absolutely stay put.
2 months ago, I bought a cheap ’95 Nissan truck.
I was only locally driving, so it took the better part of a week to realize I couldn’t put it to 60mph, or that I had to floor it to hit 3500 rpm.
(although it has a little transmission-slippage from 1st to 2nd only when dead-cold, this problem is the engine for sure as I can’t rev it past 3k in my driveway without feeling like I’m going to break something,
I can only get the 3500 rpm when driving and flooring it.
It’ll hit close to 3500 right before gear-shifts)
I was trying to methodically rule out what could be causing this power-sap, i.e. is it the air or fuel or a clogged cat or exhaust, etc. or something entirely different?
I ruled out “different”, I think, by seeing that it will roll down-hill just fine in neutral, so no mechanical interferences.
Hey! I read somewhere that it can ruin his puppy teeth and small parts can be dangerous.
Is it safe to give him a bone?
They are pretty big, almost his size.
Can I give my 2-month Boston Terrier puppy raw beef bones?
[HELP] My puppy has suddenly refused to poop anywhere except inside.
My friends think she said that because she was with her new man and she needed me to not blow her phone up, etc.
Others think it’s a way for her to be evil, like think of me, because I’m never coming to get that charm.
I think it’s some type of hoover, good or bad.
Any insight is appreciated.
If you’re a woman, please tell me your perspective.
So confused, but she is clearly with someone else, and why couldn’t she call me back and why didn’t she respond to my text messages?
She could’ve said “I’m with my boyfriend, please don’t call me”, but she didn’t.
Just a side note: my boyfriend and I are buying a house.
We will be moving out in 2 months.
Once the papers are all finalized.
I have an Australian Shepherd, 9 months.
My boyfriend (24M) and I (25F) got her at 3 months.
We take her on play dates every other week.
She has a pair of dogs she likes to play tag with, a black Labrador and a small dog that is a mix of something.
We take her to see a Rat Terrier.
Their play style is boxing.
And one of my room mates (25M) has a Beagle.
He doesn’t like to play much.
In fact, he seems kind of scared too.
I know all of these things about my dog.
I know that it doesn’t matter if your dog is friendly, aggressive, or otherwise, doesn’t matter if your dog is already barking and growling, or just minding its own business.
What matters is that my dog is nervous.
So when I hold my hand out and tell you, “no, he’s not sitting or lying down because he’s calmly waiting for you to say hi, it’s because he’s nervous and insecure”,  I don’t mean it as a joke, and it’s not an invitation for you to say, “aw, well my dog/child is very friendly, so let me approach!”
I don’t care if your dog/child is friendly or “dog savvy”.
I don’t care if your dog “is just a puppy”.
(why the hell is that even relevant?
Is my dog not allowed to be nervous around other puppies?).
I don’t care if your child is capable of not screeching “oh my God, a puppy”.
Can you, you know, do something about your child? And also your dog?
But with less than 3 months to go for that, I feel I’m not ready yet, but having never taken it, I have nothing to compare it to besides colleagues’ advice.
Without knowing what I know, they can’t know if I’m actually ready yet, but many of them are pushing me to sign up for it.
I want this bad and it would be awesome to be done 6 months from my introductory exam.
I’m close... I just don’t know if I’m 2 months study close.
Some certified advice.
(M/5’10”/26/165-195lbs) 2 months progress, am I gaining too much weight?
I know this sounds weird, but here’s my issue.
About 4 months ago, I had an 3700X which died after start, crashing when I tried to play games, and a day later not booting.
I sent to RMA, they confirmed the CPU was dead and gave my money back after 2 months.
After that I got an 3800X.
As soon as I tried, I got the boot code 7b, everything powered up but no reboots or video signal.
I sent to RMA this time with the store.
After 1 month they confirmed the CPU was faulty and sent me a new one.
I got the new one yesterday, same issue.
My mom (T) has always been the type where her feelings matter first and only.
If something she does is wrong, she manipulates it into being someone else’s fault entirely.
For example: I needed someone to babysit our then 2-month-old for 3-4 hours.
Dad’s work had someone who had Covid.
We opted out of them watching our son and asked my sister.
I approached this topic as usual with T by trying to talk to her before I set it all up, because I knew it would upset her.
T got her hopes up, then its my fault and she tried getting me to apologize for getting her hopes up.
I talked to her days after the incident, because she didn’t call me after hanging up on me, told her how I felt about the whole thing,
T promptly got off the phone.
I never got an apology.
B still thinks I am owed an apology, other things have happened since then due to T’s narcissism.
I don’t expect an apology from T, because she never has once ever apologized for anything she’s ever done wrong.
Would I be the asshole for keeping our house in the divorce so I can rent out the other rooms?
My EBF son is 5.5 months, 75th percentile weight and ahead in most milestones.
Since 2 months, he’s co-slept with us because of frequent night wakings.
We have all the bad habits - including nurse to sleep and nurse to nap, yes, the entire nap.
I’ve been sleeping 1-2 hour intervals for what feels like forever.
TLDR: tips/support to get a 2-month baby sleeping beyond one sleep cycle in bassinet (currently replacing pacifier every hour).
First time mother to a sweet 2-month-old girl, and I’m finding any progress we’ve made with sleeping is gone.
First time mother struggling with sleeps.
So I already have an orange golden chinchilla (Toto, 2 months old) and we have had Toto for 3 weeks now and felt she needed company, so we got Terri (2-month Himalayan Ragdoll) to keep each other company.
It’s only been a few hours and she feels very sleepy, but when we pet her she sounds like a running car motor.
Just always going “brr rrr rrr”.
I’m not sure if she has a blocked nose, because Toto never made this kind of sound...
Am I just being paranoid?
Cat is making a purr noise or something similar?
I can’t play until tomorrow but would like to know, so I can make money hunting or robbing everything and everyone.
How much do pelts sell for online?
Usually I’m quietly confident going into these games but with injuries, players missing etc., I’m kind of happy if we get a draw.
I know they’re utter piss and paper-wise, we should be wiping the floor with them, but I’m just not feeling the 2/3-nil vibe at the moment!
Anyone want to talk me round and make me feel happy and warm and confident again?
This is the story all about how my life got flip turned upside down-wait never mind, shit meme.
I was 6 and playing Lego Rock Band,
I decided to ask for the Buddy Holly pack.
My parents (despite being in their 40’s) said “how the shit do you know that?”
I never realised that my parents got into Weezer.
So that’s how I got into Weezer.
I genuinely don’t understand how “toxic” behavior is more punished than literally int or troll.
Well, I’ve had an account which always received those rewards for being friendly or sportsmanlike until I got in a bad streak of losses in ranked, and in a longer run my account got chat restricted.
Then I read some of the things that had been marked as toxic behavior.... And most of it were arguments.
The bot that searches your in-game chat for toxic behavior after a report doesn’t understand the context.
I asked him if I should eat cereal or just wait until the morning, but then I said “never mind, I just realized it’s almost 2.
I’ll just wait”.
And then he asked what would happen if I ate it right now and I said nothing.
It’s just too late.
Now he’s telling me to just say “fuck it” and just eat the cereal.
So inspiring, but I just put my rubber bands in so it’s too officially late :-(
Before I realized it was 2.
Help, lol, oh wait, I can just Google it.
Never mind, lol
How to delete a subreddit.
I know your skin isn’t perfect or you’re insecure about your nose or looks.
But those flaws are what makes you different.
It gives you an identity amidst all of these people that live a fake perfect life.
You’re beautiful, because you’re you.
Rant over.
Actually, never mind.
God, why did you give me this huge ass nose?
I’m too ugly to even rant on Snapchat, so I do it on Reddit instead.
Ok, it’s over now. Hopefully.
Can I get an RIP in the chat boys?
I was trying to go to sleep, because I couldn’t, when I got two notifications from this girl I really liked, but I didn’t look at my phone and I went back to sleep.
Fucking kill me.
I’ll keep you updated on what she says, because she only said my name in all caps and then a “never mind”.
Fuck.
I just realized I’m complaining over a 5-minute fix…
I don’t like him or anything, but I had some dreams about him where I cheated on my boyfriend with him.
I wouldn’t do that to him of course, but I was just wondering how bad is it to cheat?
Me: I’m highkey liking boys more right now.
lol, this is no culture.
I’m still trying to fucking finish this project while studying for a final on Wednesday.
And it’s my actual birthday tomorrow, lol.
This is not meant as a rant.
It’s only just informing Oro mains that they look noobs whenever they play Oro.
Never mind, I guess this is a rant.
Never mind, it’s back up.
That’s like ordering food at a restaurant and then saying “ah, never mind, I want to eat somewhere else” as soon as they’re bringing the food out.
I played a game as Rengar and I was 6/2 and got solo killed by Anvia who didn’t have Rod of Ages or Tear finished yet.
I looked over at the replay 100 times and all I can think to my self is, if we both played the 1v1 perfectly which we both did, the Anivia will win CNA.
Someone please explain why the fuck an Anivia is strong than a Rengar in a 1v1 when the Rengar has a gold lead?
Actually, never mind. I don’t care.
I’m just quitting this brain dead game.
I hit her fender in a parking lot, we checked the damage and both agreed to just let it be.
But after I drove off, she follows me for about 30 seconds and says “never mind”, so I just gave her mine and went on with my day.
I’m so sick of hearing the same beats of Mexican music, ahh!
Edit: I lied: the party started at 8 am and the music stopped just now at 7:30 pm.
God, if I have to go through this every weekend, I’ll just kill myself.
Edit 2: lol, 10 minutes later, never mind, the music started again.
What the fuck!
Edit 3: It started raining, so the party ended haha!
People go in the dark alone.
No one could be that stupid!
If there’s a ghost in the house, why the hell would you go in the darkest and creepiest place in the house?!
Then they turn the flashlight a little too far and see the ghost.
Then they know they’re screwed.
4. The fuck are you splitting up for?!
There’s always this one guy in horror movies that’s like: “Guys, there’s a crazy ass killer running around so we should totally split up and get ourselves killed”!
That’s exactly what the killer wants!
We get it, you’re mad the P90 is good.
Just build, lol.
All this Reddit has been is “true_warrior is a bad person, oh never mind, he’s good” and “P90 is broken. I’m quitting the game”.
lol, never mind, I’m still here. I can’t sleep.
lmao, it’s just me, never mind.
Just what the title says.
Do you pick up insects and spiders with your bare hands?
I’m deathly afraid of insects and spiders, so I don’t know what to do.
I want to kill them before they get away.
Play a scuffed 24-hour WOW livestream filled with condescending undertones, belittling, and shitty half-assed ill-prepared gameplay. Throw begging, depression and sob stories on top of it and call it couples stream.
An Altarian virus, anything is possible.
In fact, that day on Onias Three, you were infected with the cell of its hosts ten days ago.
You have been in a coma, delirious.
Your fever broke this morning.
I don’t have one, because I’m 17 and haven’t gotten around to it (and no, I’m not driving, because I’m terrified) and that I haven’t gotten my gender marker changed, so no updated documents at all.
I have a passport from a while ago from before transitioning, so that doesn’t have an updated name either.
So I have no idea what to do, because I’m going to an event with them on the 14th.
If it helps, my dad’s a flight attendant (has been for like ever).
Should I cancel?
There is always next year, but, like, I’m lonely in real life, because my boyfriend is an hour away, and as much as I love my other real life buddies, I’d like a breath of fresh air :-(
I don’t know if I will.
If I do, I will be in my mid 30’s, because I want to live life my way.
But I need to have sex to have kids and that isn’t going to happen (because honestly “me too”).
I have to go camping for a scuba certification.
There is a grill and they will eat burgers.
But I am on a vegetarian diet.
(I eat some animal products but much less than I did before.
I eat 80% vegetarian)
I got pretty close with an equalizer with a little low end and high end shaved off, going into a soft clipper.
The equalizer before it makes it Slam.
I was going to try distortion and a limiter after, when I get off work.
(The limiter was highly suggested in the last post, so hopefully that’ll do the trick) I’m just looking for advice!
You can easily get an infinite powerlock in longer fights.
I have a 4/40 Dr Octopus, and I see some pretty good numbers on critical hits and SPS, so not bad in damage either (like vision).
A very viable option for AW attack. and also arenas, as you don’t have to bait out in those small fights, because you never let them reach SP3 before you finish it.
Get ready boys.
Pogo will not open for me.
It keeps saying this device is blah blah blah… you guys know what I’m talking about.
Anyway, to fix this, I am on Android 6.0 before the security update and I have root with Magisk 16.0.
Personally, I think VII was (alongside RB1) the best Neps games in the entire franchise, what with having a storyline that doesn’t come off as too edgy nor melodramatic like Mk2/RB2, but neither as over-the-top like V/RB3, having the exact and necessary amount of seriousness and comedy.
The characters got much better developed, and everyone (specially Vert, Nepgear and the Twins) got their own time to shine and of course, it proves that the events don’t always have to rely on Neptune’s presence.
Great bait, mate. I relate, straight appreciate, and congratulate.
I rate this bait an 8/8.
Please no hate,
I’m straight irate.
Create more,
Can’t wait.
We should conversate.
I won’t berate.
My number is 8888888,
I’ve taken quite a few of these classes as a physics major for my electives... and I will take no more.
They go up to the board and just starting writing math: Meh, ok, that’s fine.
They then use shit like A subtract 1 through A subtract 20 for variables.
In fact, I have a linear algebra book that did this... A’s for everything.
The pages were just matrices filled with A’s.
Just draw a weird shape or something - anything but that shit!
Scariest thing ever mate.
Well, well, here we are again, frustrated, angry in front of my phone.
What a neat way to start isn’t it?
All of you readers are my therapy and I don’t owe you a cent.
Perfect, right?
If you are like me you are probably not going to read it all because of your short attention span, so let’s keep it short (what a genius way to write after a long introduction saying “keep it short - I’m a genius aren’t I?”)
Well I tried explaining to my buddies that porn is kind of shabby, and yeah just bad, and you know who listened…
Hey, I just want to know what games I can run on this PC and which not.
I was a spy, and on the first night I was jailed and I proudly told the jailor my role.
I also got attacked whilst in jail.
When day 2 had begun, Mafia and Serial Killer had made their kills.
I proudly said: “I was attacked while in jail!”
Wrong move.
Jailor decides to jail me again and asks me “You were attacked while you were in jail?” and I answer “yes mate”.
He then tells me that what I am saying is bullshit, because Serial Killer and Mafia have already made their kills.
Then he executes me.
Seriously?!
Oh boy, you are too dumb for the movie, boy.
The director was like “shit, it’s about the hidden meanings you have to find, boy, like you know it doesn’t spoon-feed you the film, you know?”
Like shit, why does it have to explain, mate.
Just imagine what happened, you know?
It’s not like I pretend it has a deeper meaning than what it has, you know?
Yet when fully charged for the first 30-60 minutes, it’s always on!
Which is beautiful!
Lastly, if I do not use the Smok Alien for an extended amount of time (say at night when sleeping), the battery reduces when left in the mod and the mod is turned off.
What the fuck, mate?
I just want to understand if all of this is the same for everyone, or is it just me?
In searching Google, I cannot find an answer to any of these questions.
Other than these issues, I am really enjoying the mod.
It’s just a fucking ball ache every single time I want to vape to have to wait for the fucking thing to go through its motions before I can puff...
Every time I log on, I want to chill away from keyword NMZ, and play Xbox and be fat, right, but lately I log on, play RS away from keyword for like 20 seconds and I get logged out, and it’s fucking annoying.
Is it my internet connection or is it the servers or what?
It’s pissing me off, mate.
Next we have my statistics class, and I didn’t realize that we had additional homework to do online as well as the written homework; and so my grade was a 70 something, and then I bombed my final for it because of some family emergency that popped up involving my uncle and a car in a hit and run.
So then my band class is basically easy A as it’s show up to a weekly practice and go to the one concert, and so I passed that. Good game, easy, mate.
Dramatic death scenes and bringing the characters back with a gag do not go hand in hand.
So I finally got to Blighttown, and was strolling about, minding my business, and a sniper started throwing darts at me.
So I was like “what the fuck, mate?” and hid behind some destructible wood.
After a certain time, he stopped attacking, so I showed myself and he reappeared, and started with the darts again.
So a couple dozen darts after, I simply get +500 souls, and that purple moss stuff.
So what the hell happened there.
Did the motherfucker just kill himself in shame or what, he simply died all of the sudden?
This year’s rookie game is actually going to be real exciting.
What line-ups do you want to see?
I love this show, but sadly I’m near to finishing it already.
What is this called and are there other movies or shows based on this really special kind of story?
I never watch movies or… so sorry about my lack of vocabulary on this though, is this called dystopian?
Well I’m really lost, but I just want some other stuff like this to watch, it’s crazy!
Has it happened to anyone else?
It happened to me a number of times.
So if you’re on leg 2, you have to win 10 consecutive games for the XP and coins, 10 stamina for 40 tickets.
Get the fuck out of here, EA!
But now it just doesn’t make sense. You only get 1 ticket per match, and if you are lucky, you will get 10 extra in every 20 matches.
Only in leg or WC 1.
This tournament was the one thing free-to-play was always able to do because of the low cost of entrance and the rewards were good enough compared to how many matches you need to play.
You got a player extra and if you don’t like him, use it as XP.
[Suggestion] if you don’t like the new WT, then don’t play it.
Closed tech support?
It’s, 1:30am and you’re a billion-dollar, global enterprise.
What the literal fuck?
Was your heating bill too much this month so you can’t make your rent?
You mismanaged bunch of fools.
So, long story short, I forgot to fill out the housing application for the fall ’22 semester, and I’m on the waitlist since April.
Housing isn’t guaranteed when you’re not a freshman, and my income isn’t enough for rent so…
There’s a possibility, I might be homeless.
My answer is simple: Have you seen the men nowadays?
No fucking competition.
Most men this day are thirsty as fuck.
The era of gentlemen is over.
They are either idiots, look like a half-assed rapper or are complete assholes.
Often times all of that.
In their primitive brains, they grab and grunt at everything with two legs.
And I mean that literally.
But – that’s good for you.
If you just behave like a decent human being, then you are already better than 80% of the other dudes.
I (24M), an accountant at a traveling company.
We ask our clients to pay their debts weekly, and today I called one of our agents and a girl picked up.
She was their accountant and asked her if they will pay their debts, and she said “yes, I will be at your company at 21:00”.
I said “ok, and at 21:00, she came by and asked who is the accountant”.
I said “I am, please follow me to the room”.
She came and I asked her how much did she bring.
She said “I have $1300 with me”, which will not cover all of their debts by the way, so I brought a receipt and wrote down the amount and the company name and then I asked her for her name.
She smiled and looked at me and said my name.
So none of my friends are answering me 😭😭
So, it’s time to make some new ones!
I’m in the mood to call, so let me know if you’re down!
Looking to talk to people around my age.
I’ve posted before so you can check out my profile for more info.
I’m a little lazy right now 🥴
Anyways, let me know what your favorite type of music is 🙃
I had been wearing Lane Bryants Lounge Bras the past four-ish years, and so this was the first time in a very long time that I wore a bra with wire.
So come Monday, I wore my new bra with wire that fit perfectly at the store, but after a few hours it felt so uncomfortable!
I am worried I wasted my money… :-(
I’m so miserable and seriously just want to cancel my trip but don’t want to disappoint my husband.
He’s been looking forward to a vacation for so long.
I’m dreading the plane ride so bad!
Luckily the flare is a bit higher and not right where I make contact when sitting, but it still hurts like a motherfucker.
I’m going to be walking around in 40 degree weather with a big angry boil on my ass.
God help me 😫
Hey, there.
Hi guys, I was drinking with my friends from the US and my boyfriend and everyone’s fallen asleep, and I want to play some truth or dare or drink, so if you have Discord or Kik, just message me, owo
So I just had my baby with the man of my dreams 4 months ago :-) and it felt like I was living my fairytale life.
I was in my exact vision I had, but then, long story short, postpartum with new emotions had me pull a crazy move and I checked his phone about a month ago now, only to find out he was meeting up with a  chick, doing favors for her, spending time in her room and texting a lot, all while I was pregnant.
Now he and her both say they are just friends and never hooked up (yes, I contacted her number), lol, but I don’t want to lose my man, though I also saw he has dating profiles and he says he doesn’t do it all the time.
And he won’t do it anymore.
I don’t want my baby’s parents to split, plus I love him and want our vision to carry on.
But how?
Please help.
Can I? Or should I trust him again ?
Day 17 of posting Corgi stuff (sorry for not posting for so long)
I have insomnia and I can’t sleep at night, and it’s just like I have so many ideas at night that just so many ideas keeping my up at night.
Please tell me how sometimes I can get better sleep.
Because of that, I almost failed school and because of skipped lessons, and people tell me to listen, but just, like, I talk with somebody, and then I just think of something.
I forgot what I was about to say, and I had a math tutor, but iI couldn’t focus and just also my mind is like chaos people.
Tell me.
Oh, I don’t want to take medication and I’m sensitive to medicine.
Digital cameras are either super expensive, or the type of camera you would use for vlogging or things like that.
She probably already has one also.
A real digital movie camera costs so damn much.
So I opted for an analog one.
Now, 8mm/Super 8 have an affordable price, 16mm doesn’t cost much, and 35mm costs a lot, so I think I’m going for a Super 8.
But then how does it work?
lol, I mean, I buy her a Super 8, but I should also buy her a video recorder, and some VHS… things like that.
I don’t know how it works.
Please can someone explain to me what should I do.
How do you guys do it?
It’s so scary, but I want to last forever with him, and I know I can’t tell the future, but we’ve been through so much together.
How do you guys keep it going through all the obstacles life throws at you... how?
Do you want to run some Minecraft? XD
I’m bored and my friends are busy or out right now, so...
I finished the game for the first time today.
What a wonderful and amazing game.
It hits right in the feels and fucks your mind up at times.
My ending was sad.
Kara and Alice die (I am bad at controls), North dies, Hank dies, Marcus is successful, but I let Connor kill him, because I guess I was doing kind of a role-play where Connor is the villain and the outcome is realistic.
I will try to open other openings.
But yes, the game was so good.
Hi guys, this year was my third year at Glastonbury, and I loved it so much and hope you guys did too!
I am an aspiring doctor/medical student, and so seeing a lot of medicine-related subjects as early in our first semester I was so excited.
Then UPCA results came in, surprise!
I passed for UPLB BS Biology!
To be honest though, this wasn’t my priority program, so of course I had mixed emotions.
I was elated to finally be a scholar, but I was also worried, because I’m not really as interested in Biology as invested I already was in Physical Therapy.
Sure, I could learn to love Biology, sure I could transfer to UPM the next year, but that’s not certain.
I will play with anyone on 2K21.
I’m an 87 over 3 level scorer. As one that will play with anyone, REP and OVR don’t matter.
I have no one to play with most of the time, and no randoms want to play with me.
Please play with me.
I promise I won’t sell.
I can shoot.
I have an 81 three, but I can shoot.
I’m a shooting guard.
I need someone who knows how to land planes on PC to help me.
That’s all.
I just need you to land the plane.
I know how to do the rest of the mission, but the plane has been messing me up for hours.
Please help as soon as possible.
My discord is SingSong254.
Contact me there, then I’ll give you my Ubisoft account information.
Thanks.
Help, I need someone who knows how to fly planes well on PC to join me.
Let’s fucking go!
What’s up guys?
I drop around 30 kills a game right now, and I’m trying to get out of low ranks and get into Platinum.
If you’re good at the game but simply don’t have a Stack, add me on Discord and we can rank up together.
Just to clarify, when I say “anything” I mean anything within the FM’s current power.
So no answers like “remove the nukes” or “boot the royals”.
We cannot do that (not yet at least…).
You become the first minister tomorrow and you can do anything without repercussions.
What do you do?
Me and my real life friends need a team that we (or especially I) can VOD review in order to learn about tarping, switching layers and positioning.
I was thinking Wolf/Soldier/Wilkinson but I’m not sure if there are any better ones.
Preferably EU as we are EU, and some stuff happening is basically exclusive to EU, lol, but I guess it could be NAE as well.
Thank you!
Looking for someone to play with right now.
No toxics and no obnoxious people.
I don’t fuck with that.
18+ NAE.
I just play for fun.
You can be bad.
I don’t care about skills 😇
One word I simply can’t say properly is water...
It actually hurts my brain trying to add the T, and I sound American if I do or still say wut-ta.
I don’t know why it’s so hard for me to say, to be honest.
I was just wondering what people’s thoughts are when you meet people who drop H’s and have glottal stops.
So I got a Sky Q Mini Box for upstairs.
It doesn’t work.
I have to wait until late March for an engineer.
lol
So I will be starting a job next week and desperately need to move down to the city its based out off, as a daily commute is impossible.
Looking for single bedroom flats or flat-shares is a legitimate issue as three letting agents in the city own them all, and are only letting to students.
Vacuum won’t stop sucking. Please send help. Is it going to blow?
Basically, if you didn’t know what that is, it’s basically an example of two sentences.
One says “Let’s eat granny” making it seem like someone’s going to eat their nan.
However, the other example says “Lets eat, granny”, implying a different meaning to the sentence.
A pretty creative way to teach kids to use commas, I guess.
I literally couldn’t have been more at fault
I just drove straight into this woman’s Golf while changing lanes (it was raining and I did not see it).
She seemed nice but understandably pissed.
She took my insurance and my number and said it’s my choice if I want to go through insurance and she would call me.
The crash damage was minute to my car and I think to hers as well, just very minor body work and paint, maybe a small dent.
What broadband do I get?
I’ve had Virgin for 8 years, and holy shit, is it slow for £40 monthly.
Is it the old router or do I just switch to a cheaper BT or whatever?
Jeans, T-shirt, steel-cap boots, boiler suit (lol), high vis, gloves, goggles, dust mask, ear protection.
Help. I’m melting…
Edit: the heat has got to my spelling ability first. The end is nigh.
I’m sure as eggs is eggs that I’m not the only one that goes to the gas pump, and I want say £10, 9 times out of 10 it will go £10.01.
Bloody things are rigged like a slot machine, I swear, lol.
lol - small acknowledgement of a joke you sort of enjoyed but didn’t actually laugh to.
LOL - adults and people who don’t really know how the internet works use this
Lol - I’m not sure why this came up, but it’s likely an autocorrect, but if anyone types this on purpose they are probably a huge dweeb.
Business-lol is what it has been named.
LoL - Grandma lol, confused with lots of love.
It’s also confusing because of League of Legends.
loool - now, I think my girlfriend pronounces this, but she says that this one would rhyme with “spool”, but I think it’s the drawn-out “o”.
So yeah, I think this is actual lols, she thinks it doesn’t exist.
lolll - when I hear her say “loool”, this is what she says she is actually saying.
I sort of get it. but I still think that’s “loool”,
You can’t repeatedly pronounce a consonant.
So, when is Big Ben going to bong again?
But the filters cost £15 a pop!
Can anyone reccomend one?
Preferably under £50!
Also, does anyone have tips on how to reduce dust in my house that are not energy consuming (that don’t require me to stand for lengths of time).
I have just bought tumble dryer balls to hopefully help reduce lint on my clothing.
It seems no matter what I do, I literally can’t keep the dust at bay for more than 24 hours, and I am losing my mind.
It’s 10pm, 28°C, and my bum is literally melting.
Saturday session three and chat.
If this bear isn’t named Beary McBearface, we have failed as a society.
It’s 32°C here inside my flat.
I have taken the t-shirt off and soaked it in cold water.
I’m wearing it.
What genius ways are you keeping cool whilst working from home or somewhere extremely hot with no AC?
Bloody lovely fucking weather, isn’t it?
16 hours in Wetherspoons.
Okay, so I went out with my girlfriend to go to 7-11 and I had my hair in my face, a hoodie, and a mask, and someone called me he/him.
Bruh, I’m so happy right now, what the fuck (I’m non-binary and use all pronouns, but nobody has ever used he/him for me and it feels really good)
To the neighbor that went out of their way just to check on me, I appreciate that.
I just wanted to say from one Gen Z to Millennials, good on you guys.
I hope you find what you’re looking for. It’s been fun being your little buddies in life.
Remember, there’s a lot of fish in the sea!
As somebody that doesn’t experience a lot of positive moments, this subreddit does make me smile :-)
