nm-0	My favorite Obama quote: “Michael and I also want to… uh… acknowledge… uh… uh… uh… your son Jack, who deployed today.”
nm-1	New-ish player, couple of questions about parrying, etc.
nm-2	Basically the title.
nm-2	We’re both xxx majors (I’m a dual xxx and yyy major while she’s a xxx major and yyy minor, so we are taking 2-3 classes together every semester until graduation in May 2018).
nm-2	While I wouldn’t say I’m smarter than her, things tend to come more naturally to me, and I’m a good test-taker, while she has a lot of test anxiety (she will often get questions wrong that me and her practice right before the exam, will freak out about not having a formula that was on the formula sheet, etc.), but she easily studies more than I do.
nm-3	Me [20F] with my friend [23F] of 2-3 years, we’re both in college together, and she gets massively down on herself every time she takes an exam.
nm-3	It’s driving me crazy, how to deal with it?
nm-4	Her: Oh, where’s this ice luge, haha?
nm-4	Me: Probably my friend’s hotel room or wherever he can find a place for it.
nm-4	Me: I came to <insert city> with my fraternity and a sorority – that’s why he’s getting it.
nm-4	Her: Gotcha!
nm-4	Her: What fraternity and sorority I’m in xxx.
nm-4	Me: yyy. sorority is zzz.
nm-4	Me: You’re interesting though.
nm-4	I want to hang out with you.
nm-4	When this week?
nm-4	Her: Uh, maybe Friday?
nm-4	Me: Ah, yes.
nm-4	Me: Friday.
nm-4	*one day later*
nm-4	Me: <girl’s name>, we’re hanging out tomorrow, right?
nm-5	How to go from number to date?
nm-6	I just pretty much dismissed what she said by saying a vibe is not captured by pre-googling and confirmed the time that I’ll be there.
nm-6	If she gives any further resistance, I think I’ll just next her, ignore her, not respond to her, agree with her that she can’t handle the place, or tease her about the crazy high standards she has for a first freaking date.
nm-7	This is a nagging annoyance I have with the Word text object.
nm-7	Suppose the cursor is located in the “aaa” word, and I want to yank four words without selecting the spaces after “ddd”:  > xxx **aaa bbb ccc ddd** yyy
nm-8	It is the bar with the team composition and the status of each character that is used to follow “report team” (like in the actual World Cup).
nm-8	It can be tweaked down to not reveal too much information about the red team, but it will make following the killfeed easier, and you won’t have to use tab.
nm-9	The part I’m humming is like “word word word wo-o-o-ord” twice.
nm-9	So he draws out the 4th (?) word.
nm-9	I think it was something like “fly-y-y-yyy.”
nm-9	I’m pretty sure it’s a popular song; I’ve heard it many times.
nm-9	Thanks!
nm-10	I’m having trouble with if / then / else / end in a repeat loop.
nm-11	Haha.
nm-11	Oh my god, it’s terribly funny!
nm-12	I went grocery shopping.
nm-12	I’m down to my last dollars soon, and I can’t just eat beer and cigarettes.
nm-12	Then I set them down so I didn’t have to carry them across the street to get beer (it’s cheaper at Adventure’s First Stop).
nm-12	Then I walked back and forgot my groceries.
nm-12	I walked all the way home and, ah shit, I’m getting shin splints from all this walking up and down the hill.
nm-12	I live on a hill. Down. In the middle, really.
nm-12	I imagine it’s like an amateur San Francisco.
nm-12	So I walked back and got them.
nm-12	No crime round these parts.
nm-12	Not much, anyway.
nm-13	I hope the title makes sense.
nm-13	I have a list of names “john.baker” (no spacing between names other than the period) and need it broken into 2 columns “john” and “baker”.
nm-13	Thanks!
nm-14	I have to break up the format “xxx.yyy” into two separate columns “xxx” and “yyy”.
nm-15	I am confused.
nm-15	What’s going on, lol?
nm-15	This is my first time with SFU e-mail.
nm-15	After the semester I haven’t touched anything school-related until today heh, so I don’t know how to fix this.
nm-16	Even better for me it would be:
nm-16	It would be an unbelievable loss to let a broken and thus spilt bottle be wasted with no return.
nm-16	So to show my sincerest apologies for bumping straight into a noble that half-marched in his drunken stupor down the sidewalk, straight out of a liquor store and making him drop his bottle worth more than what I suppose one of the merchants off the main street makes in a month, I was invited to finish the wasted goods, lest they spoil any further.
nm-16	“Yes sir! May the heavens cry before your merciful heart!”
nm-16	“Now get lost! This is no place for disease-ridden vermin like you.”
nm-16	“Of course my lord!”
nm-16	I ran back down the alley I squirmed my way out of. Filled to the brim with anger and shame.
nm-16	Sidestreets and alleyways, down I went. Further and further out of sight.
nm-17	He, as soon as he saw that I was weeping, answered,  “Come with me.”
nm-17	Onward he moved, I close his steps pursued.
nm-17	Entering, he led me with him on the bounds of a great circle itself encircling a great abyss.
nm-17	Ere, I beheld an uneven land covered with lava pyramids, with sickly farms of melons and carrots, near barren of life save for those imprisoned in it, who, though they surrounded us, dared not approach for fear of the master.
nm-17	As my ear could note, the sound was heard of screams, cries, and explosions that made the eternal air tremble, caused by slaughter, starvation, withering, and frief felt by those multitudes, many and vast, of men, women, and children.
nm-18	I recently returned to D2 after several year, now I’m wondering:
nm-18	Where do you guys sell or buy your stuff?
nm-18	Do you just make a game “O xxx N yyy” and hope for the best?
nm-18	Or is there a website that’s more efficient?
nm-19	Who is a former (or still) important person in your country, that constantly compromises himself/herself on social media?
nm-20	It’s not until my next billing cycle that I noticed something was off.
nm-20	I was a bit lower than normal and I keep a very close eye on my expenses.
nm-20	I looked over my bank statements and there it was:
nm-20	My new Prime bill.
nm-20	I was super confused and got hold of Amazon’s customer support.
nm-20	They helped me as much as they could, but because I was receiving my service through the phone company, I would have to go though them and figure out the problem.
nm-20	The next day that I had off, I walked in and talked to a very sweet girl, who tried to understand what my problem was.
nm-20	We kind of talked in circles for a bit as I tried to explain what the Amazon customer service told me.
nm-20	We looked me up in their system and there I was: 2 lines, but no Prime membership for either one of us.
nm-20	She could see the date I opened my first line and then the second.
nm-20	Both dates added up to what I had told her before.
nm-20	She stared at the computer screen for a while with a confused look on her face.
nm-21	Anyways, these terrible memories kept haunting me, so yesterday I finally mustered up the courage to message him.
nm-21	Me: Hey, how’s everything?
nm-21	Him: It’s been a long time.
nm-21	Me: Sorry about last year.
nm-21	I was super awkward around you, lol.
nm-21	Him: lol, no, don’t worry about it.
nm-21	*drum roll please*
nm-21	Me: To be honest, I liked you blah blah blah…
nm-21	Him: Haha, you could’ve just told me!
nm-21	Next time you see me just say hi.
nm-21	Do you still go to <school>?
nm-21	I’m not like r/Nicegirls but that reply didn’t sit well with me.
nm-22	I’m out, boys :-)
nm-23	Now I obviously can’t get out and shut it on the main road, so I pull down a few side streets and ensure that no one fucking knows I’ve quickly jumped out and shut it.
nm-23	I jump back in and drive home like nothing’s happened.
nm-24	I don’t remember specifically which, I think both bugs do it, but here in Florida, there’s a particular bug that makes a loud sound 100 times longer than when it’s not making a sound.
nm-24	I’d describe it as that trademark desert ambiance sound.
nm-25	Locusts, grasshoppers, etc. can shut the hell up.
nm-26	I’ve searched far and wide across the internet with nothing to show for it.
nm-26	They could even go woah eee ahh ahh/oh eee ahh.
nm-26	The possibilities are endless and I know it’s hard.
nm-26	I’m just wondering if anyone knows it, thanks!
nm-27	What to do: my plant’s now way too small for its age in my opinion and has started to grow pistils.
nm-27	Should I chop and restart or…?
nm-28	How do you get destiny delicacies?
nm-28	I’ve seen a few people have them, but I’ve never got one.
nm-28	I don’t know where you get them.
nm-28	If anyone knows, it would be a lot of help :-)
nm-29	Every time I listen to him, shit makes so much sense, even though I don’t know what he is talking about.
nm-29	That leads me to believe that either that guy is a genius who can articulate what’s going on in the economy right now in a brilliant way, or he may be missing something.
nm-29	I mean what should I listen to if I really want to find out the truth, if Schiff is just “biased toward gold”, and that’s the reason why he is so hard on the current economy, etc.
nm-30	This wouldn’t be an issue if all your servers asked at the beginning “do you guys want a separate check so it won’t be awkward.”
nm-30	Also, why restaurants have to be set up like that? Why can’t you just get up to the cashier and pay for your fucking share of the food?
nm-30	Why can’t you just get up to the cashier and pay for your fucking share of the food?
nm-31	So I don’t know why I got on everyone’s nerves about the separate checks…
nm-32	But every time, my narcissistic mom says that it can’t be true, because when she was my age, her periods were 3 days long and super light.
nm-32	“It barely ever affected me, so how can it be affecting you so much?”
nm-32	Um, I don’t know, maybe it’s because we’re different people with different bodies?
nm-33	Does anyone else’s narcissistic mom treat you like you’re overreacting about your period pains?
nm-34	I passed my FAA PPL written!
nm-35	Alright everyone, I think I mis-tagged this earlier, so I’m trying again.
nm-35	I got some not fun fungal acne from running daily with a face mask on my chin/jawline, forehead, and lower cheeks.
nm-35	Once I identified it, I switched from a face mask to a face shield while running (I have no issue with being over 12 feet from other people - I usually don’t pass anyone on my runs anyways), and then I have used the following routine to nuke it over the course of 3 weeks.
nm-36	I had never heard of this “influencer” before and consider myself pretty internet savvy.
nm-36	I then lost interest in her, because her Instagram wasn’t that interesting.
nm-36	She popped back on my radar with the Nancy thread, and then she disappeared from my mind again until the Anna article came out, and then I took a great interest in checking in on her, because I just found her funny and her antics amusing (in a sad way).
nm-36	So this has been on my mind for a while:
nm-36	How does she continue to have such loyal fans who will send her lots of money, because she claims to not be able to afford food or rent or whatever, when there is photographic evidence all over her apartment of her bougie taste in decor, perfumes (Byredo perfume costs anywhere from $200-300 a pop), shit tons of plants and flowers, which aren’t cheap.
nm-37	Basically, I just found out that this 1 girl is only snapping me again because my friend basically told her to (told a friend to tell her), and now I’m 99% sure she’s just snapping me to be nice (plus the delivery times and opened times shit are mad long).
nm-38	What should I do from here?
nm-38	Someone please let me know.
nm-39	Like, I don’t really care what mean, shit people on the internet say.
nm-39	But when I got nobody in real life, all I have is the internet, and it does kind of hurt a bit when I just want to vent my problems.
nm-39	And I’d be fine if it got maybe a single upvote and no comments, and I’d be fine.
nm-39	But instead, it’s full of people saying
nm-40	I don’t like when people type huge paragraphs or dump a lot of stress on me about their problems.
nm-40	I don’t like when people mumble on the phone or if they ramble on, and it’s all about them.
nm-41	I’m talking about “ppl” instead of people “u” or “ur” instead of “you” or “your”, “tho” instead of “though” and so on.
nm-41	It’s getting old, and you look like an idiot when you spell like this.
nm-41	Just type out the word.
nm-41	It isn’t hard.
nm-42	Maybe a little earlier, I don’t know, because I’m usually at work, but my download speed is now stuck at the 64mb/s range.
nm-42	Now I understand at peak times it should drop, I even understand that since more people are at home I’m going to see lower numbers, but to go from 500 to 60…
nm-43	I’m curious how likely it is that a post on my personal space will be shown to people.
nm-43	Please write  “+” in the comment if you see this.
nm-44	Hm, mandatory title.
nm-45	If anyone says anything remotely offensive on the internet, everyone just has to say you can die or something.
nm-45	Do we really care that much?
nm-45	Not really, to be honest.
nm-46	Damn, some people need to stop overreacting to stuff on the internet, Jesus!
nm-47	I’ve come up with a list of all the questions I could think about (there’s kind of a lot, lol), so I would really appreciate it if someone would take the time to answer them.
nm-47	If anyone is willing to PM me and chat about their test day experience and answer all my questions, that would be great too!
nm-48	I’m gross and only brush in the morning.
nm-48	I guess I don’t see the need, because who the fuck cares?
nm-49	But now it seems that you’re all making grits without the butter and making us madder than a wet hen, I must say!
nm-49	We were preparing to tour more plantations than Carter’s got little pills but you done gone and brought up them “slave owners” now.
nm-49	It isn’t amounting to anything more than a hill of beans!
nm-49	If I had my druthers, I’d have just taken my business over yonder to the white-friendly plantation and learnt something decent about history.
nm-49	All this chicanery has got me worn slap out!
nm-49	You get along now, do you hear?
nm-50	How do I break off a relationship with my “friend”?
nm-51	Basically, I put my skate account in my Instagram biography, because I have no posts on my main, and I’m kind of insecure about my body (in some of my clips I’m shirtless, and people won’t expect me to be like shredded or some shit if they add me), and today I got 3 followers (girls from different towns who don’t know me).
nm-51	I’m really picky though, because I don’t want to have a relationship, unless I actually feel like I’d really like the person and be into them a lot, so I didn’t follow any of them back.
nm-52	Bro, I’ve been added and un-added on Instagram so many times today that it’s kind of a confidence boost, lmao.
nm-53	Honestly, most of the posts or memes here are either from people who read the novels or the manga.
nm-53	I have to dodge so many spoilers, smh…
nm-53	I have nothing else to say, come at me angry people, lmao.
nm-54	Hi guys, I’m a casual just-for-fun gamer, playing 5-6 games a week.
nm-54	Yesterday it was just pure horror division 10…
nm-54	I could not win 1 game out of 6…
nm-54	Like, is everyone smurfing ?
nm-54	Or what’s going on?
nm-54	I know people want to play the objective.
nm-54	I get that, but why do you need to shush or watch full replay or every cut scene?
nm-55	So basically, for my A-levels I got 82 RP and wanted to go the NUS business administration but didn’t get in, though I’m quite sure my grade is good enough, and my appeal was rejected 3 days ago… *welp* :-(
nm-55	I got into SMU business administration, but I still feel damn shit that I didn’t get into NUS, so help change my mind and convince me why SMU is better than NUS, especially for business :-/
nm-55	I’m most scared that in the future when I’m working, people will look down on SMU like elitism discrimination all that, I don’t know, man.
nm-55	Or will they pay less or not even hire me?
nm-55	RIP, because SMU is kind of 2nd best and less well known.
nm-55	I would really appreciate if you all could help me out, especially those who are currently at university or have already left.
nm-55	Thanks pals :-)
nm-55	TLDR: the title.
nm-56	Other vegans that you’re friends with tell you that they don’t tell other people that they’re vegan.
nm-56	Like, they purposefully avoid it.
nm-56	I feel like it fucks over the vegan community, because they are probably the people that would be more gentle with their words, which is what some people need in order to listen.
nm-56	I’m a very straightforward, no sugarcoating type of person, and although some people appreciate it, a lot more get upset and start trying to put words in my mouth and twisting things.
nm-57	Fellow vegans, does it annoy you when...
nm-58	You honestly deserve to get scammed if you give a random guy on the internet like €300 worth of fake internet points, like, what the fuck are you doing, honestly? lol
nm-59	Why would you give awards to people? lol
nm-60	Yes, I agree things like Tumblr made-up identities are weird, and some people do get offended easily, but if what you said is ignorant/bigoted, calling people snowflakes is just weak.
nm-61	Give yourself a pat on your back if you believed and trusted Tom from the start to the end without any unsureness and trusted him and never lost hope in the series! Props to you!
nm-62	The New Year’s Eve Raticate with a hat.
nm-62	I haven’t found him anywhere yet.
nm-62	Does anyone want to raid?
nm-62	I need a few people quick.
nm-63	Stop.
nm-63	I think what I am trying to say… this game is not hard.
nm-63	Don’t make it hard yourself.
nm-63	The main objective, as I understood, is to get the dragon, and don’t die before that.
nm-63	Even better if you outfarm your opponent.
nm-63	Just don’t die.
nm-63	And trades in lane… if you see the enemy using his escape ability or even damage ability.
nm-64	And I offered to go out to look at Christmas lights, but he was out of town.
nm-64	So we couldn’t do that, and now he’s back in town, and I asked him what he’s doing on New Year’s Eve and he said he was going to hang out with two of the managers from our work.
nm-64	And like, he didn’t offer an invite, and then he said if he cancels with them, would I like to come over, and I just said I don’t know what I’m doing yet, so I don’t know.
nm-64	Am I overthinking this?
nm-64	Does he not care?
nm-65	There are going to be people on the internet saying “stat padder” but other than his weird hesitancy to drive, he played pretty solid.
nm-66	Hey, the regulars!
nm-66	I just wanted to say that I love the group channel, it’s amazing, and love your own channels as well.
nm-66	I love all your videos, and I have a suggestion for a video for the channel:
nm-66	Do a Minecraft build battle and whoever loses there, the other people get to write something on their Twitter, lol.
nm-66	I hope you like my idea and can use it for a video.
nm-67	I have a group chat.
nm-67	It’s on Discord for people who are bored or want to chat about anything.
nm-67	We already have some people who chat and stuff about anything.
nm-67	It’s chill, edgy, and if you want to join, comment and I’ll direct message you the link.
nm-68	I just kind of realized that I’ve never had New Year’s Eve plans...
nm-68	I always think about how I haven’t been able to throw birthday parties or shit like that…
nm-68	I recently realized that I still don’t have enough friends to have one for my 21st coming up…
nm-68	I don’t know why I didn’t clue into this though.
nm-68	Like, I never thought about how people have traditions for this night, besides my sister, who goes out to her friends’ every year.
nm-68	It’s funny that Covid isn’t affecting my New Year at all…
nm-68	Is anyone else in the same boat?
nm-68	Anyway, I guess I’ll just watch a movie tonight, lol.
nm-69	Hello, I’m looking for people to talk to, maybe play some games or watch anime together.
nm-69	Just please be aware that I’m not very good at upholding conversations. uwu F/20
nm-70	Like, I see videos on YouTube on it.
nm-70	But like, I can’t see any mention on the design notes, etc.
nm-70	Where do people get the information from?
nm-71	DM me to debate.
nm-71	Please be well learned in your belief.
nm-71	I want DMs, because it’ll get deep and I can’t reply to 300 people like that.
nm-71	Also, I need 500 characters so here come the blah blahs.
nm-72	I’m not saying that they should be ashamed to be turned into girls or that I’m being stereotypical towards a person being a girl, but I am saying that they won’t like to do it, because they are humans with their own choices, and not agreeing to be a girl isn’t making them a women anti.
nm-72	Like, how many guys around you would be willing to be turned into Disney princesses or to play that butt game?
nm-72	Maybe they get used to this with time but how much time?
nm-72	And maybe they know that they have to do all this for the entertainment of fans.
nm-72	But knowing this isn’t making anything better for them until they happily and genuinely agree to it.
nm-72	I sometimes feel sad for them when they are asked to do all this.
nm-72	I wouldn’t like it if you tried to make me a man and wanted me to dance in front of so many people, even though I am a tomboy.
nm-73	Is anyone missing me?
nm-73	If you miss a Reddit friend, read this.
nm-73	It could be me!
nm-74	So I just hopped on PC from PS4, not even 2.5k games played there.
nm-74	I played a few decent games since I frankly suck with a keyboard and mouse, and yet for the past week or so I am matching with people 2000 kills and predators even.
nm-74	Yet I haven’t even a hundred games played and about 80 kills with all characters.
nm-74	I’m not really having fun anymore.
nm-74	I can’t improve if I get shit on every game.
nm-75	I see a lot of people on here who seem hella sad, so if you’re really sad, I’m up for a chat.
nm-75	So yeah if you are up for a chat, or long-term friendship, I’ll be more than happy to do so.
nm-76	So I always see people talk about sending designs and edits to Affinity, but how do I do that?
nm-76	I’ve worked at OD for almost a year and none of management has mentioned it.
nm-76	Like not even the print suppliers.
nm-76	We do every type of editing in store and I hate it.
nm-76	Like we’re out here doing stuff that I’m pretty sure is supposed to get sent out to Affinity based on what I see on here.
nm-76	But yeah, is more of this information on the store portal or where can I learn more?
nm-76	I’m extremely tired of creating/editing shit for last-minute, rude customers :-)
nm-77	One person in the server was selling the set for 100k, and I was like “Hell no, that’s not worth 100k”, like bruh.
nm-78	Why do people find the new set expensive?
nm-79	I know the girl I posted about is a troll people, but oh well, she’s got her 6 minutes of fame time to take the posts down.
nm-80	Hit me up with a chat message.
nm-80	Tell me about yourself and we can go from there.
nm-81	I don’t understand how people can build what they do...
nm-81	I love building but I guess my creativity isn’t well tuned as a lot of people’s is, and it bothers me that I can’t build amazing stuff.
nm-81	I know I could if had the creative side, ugh!
nm-81	I just tend to give up after a while and settle for simple crap to pass for ok.
nm-82	I care about how I affect people a lot but try not to show it.
nm-82	It’s hard for me to join in conversations with big groups of people, which is related to ADHD.
nm-82	Sometimes my sensitivity can make me kind of stand-offish to people I don’t know.
nm-82	I’ll try to act like I don’t care if someone doesn’t like me but drunk people will fall to the floor begging them to.
nm-82	These all are ADHD things though, because of rejection sensitive dysphoria.
nm-82	I’m a good listener. A lot of people view me as really cute or innocent.
nm-82	I can have a really, really, really flirty personality at times.
nm-82	I remember in high school, my friend’s mom said I had the “personality”, so I’d probably be the first to have a boyfriend.
nm-83	But when she’s in the wrong or when someone holds her accountable, she just throws the biggest temper tantrum ever and just disrespects anyone/everyone who doesn’t agree with her and screams about how she doesn’t care.
nm-83	Or more specifically in her words “I don’t give a fuck”.
nm-83	She’ll never take accountability or apologize and becomes the biggest hypocrite.
nm-83	All the things she screams at people to not do to her, she turns around and does the exact same rude, petty shit to anyone/everyone else that doesn’t agree with her.
nm-83	I think the main reason she does this is because my sister acts just like my mom, and my mom can’t stand it/accept that
nm-83	So she becomes downright nasty.
nm-84	In class, I’ve usually been really quiet, but sometimes I’ll meet someone I click with in class and be really, really chatty.
nm-84	I think I get along best with girly fun girls, overly confident queen B, feisty type people, and just gossipy people.
nm-84	My friends and their families see me as really bubbly and excitable.
nm-84	Although most people see me as sweet, soft spoken, and quiet.
nm-84	Some people think I never talk though.
nm-84	I’ve always been a smiley, happy person though.
nm-84	I do really like making others happy or seeing people I know and having a friendly conversation.
nm-84	I have ADHD.
nm-84	Sometimes I’m at a loss for words or boring.
nm-84	I’m really, really chatty when drunk.
nm-84	Although sometimes I’m not when drunk - I heard people with ADHD are both.
nm-85	Could I be ISTP?
nm-85	Help type me please.
nm-86	I don’t know if people would even want to.
nm-86	I just want to know if that’s allowed, and if not, where would be a good place to post that.
nm-86	(I’ve watched Dragonmar and other people’s videos but that would be hard to be a me-specific video on there)
nm-87	Like in a good way though.
nm-88	Some people are just indescribable.
nm-89	I haven’t done this before, but I’ve seen enough to get a gist of it so like…interests :-)
nm-89	We can definitely talk about anime (especially romance - I’m a sucker for it), we can talk about games and go into detail about lore and stuff, creepy stories go hard, and really I’m just down for anything :-)
nm-89	I’m not gonna be weird so long as you’re not weird.
nm-89	Any age or anything is fine with me and uh yeah… if I didn’t do this right let me know :-)
nm-89	Oh and I’ll absolutely talk more on Snap.
nm-90	I mean yeah, to be honest it is.
nm-90	I care about a lot of people and I can’t just... make people be happy.
nm-90	But like… I want to :-(
nm-91	I just want to make everybody I care about happy.
nm-91	Like, is that too much to ask?
nm-92	I think that some people here are AI or something.
nm-93	smh, don’t even try.
nm-93	I can do that by myself 🤠
nm-94	Hey, F/19, bored as fuck.
nm-94	I enjoy talking to new people.
nm-94	Hit me up!
nm-95	I started chatting with her and a co-worker of hers who was in high school in the late 90’s.
nm-95	She said everyone was watching wrestling back then, and it was a cool thing.
nm-95	Now no one gives a shit 😭 (I don’t really blame them sometimes).
nm-95	I asked her “why do you think people stopped liking it”, and she said “because it’s garbage.
nm-95	It’s come on Fox on Fridays and as soon as 7 o’clock hits, I change the channel”.
nm-95	I had to include that in there, because she’s so funny 😂😂😂
nm-95	Anyways…
nm-96	Hey, I can’t fall asleep and this platform seems pretty interesting.
nm-96	Hit me up if you think we could hit it off well.
nm-96	I hope we have a great time, future chat buddy ;-) 😁
nm-97	It’s kind of weird, I’m not going to lie.
nm-98	These motherfuckers can outrun, outswim or outstam (through venom) anything that tries to get them.
nm-98	Mine is literally covered in scars head to toe from escaped or successful fights.
nm-99	I just finished the show so I’m a little behind everyone but equally obsessed and want to talk about it so much, lol.
nm-99	Also by sidestory I mean something that’s not part of the main plot!
nm-100	One of the best games ever that I have played!
nm-100	But I have some problems…
nm-101	I’d always heard of Mac for years but never really checked him out in detail until a couple of months ago, and now he’s one of my favorite and most often listened to artists right now.
nm-101	Anyway, those were just my thoughts.
nm-101	Happy New Year’s everyone!
nm-101	I hope the new year treats you well.
nm-102	Now for this one, it’s kind of hard, because the enemies are so cool for this game, but... If I had to choose, I’d say I like the clown the most.
nm-102	I just think their design and movement is super neat.
nm-102	Plus they are one of the few if not the only enemy in the game that doesn’t have a single other variation from what I remember.
nm-103	Honestly, I wasn’t going to make one, but I want to at least give my two cents especially since I disagree with a lot of others’ lists.
nm-103	Not to say that my list is right, because this is all subjective anyway, which is why I hate making them.
nm-104	Here we go again, another character fighting tier list!
nm-104	Yay!
nm-105	In my opinion, Lily for the most part is a rather likeable character (keep in mind I’ve only played a bit of season 1 up to like part of episode 3).
nm-105	Unlike her father, Lily tries to work with Lee and for the most part the group.
nm-105	She does what she has to.
nm-105	She is a bit of a bitch, because she has to.
nm-105	I only have 1 problem with Lily.
nm-105	She killed Carly.
nm-105	If you could get Ben to confess…
nm-105	Yes, I got spoiled on that and a few other things.
nm-105	Ben is useless.
nm-105	He is what looks like a college student, yet he is useless and needs rescuing 24/7.
nm-105	Please don’t downvote me into oblivion if I missed something.
nm-106	I pretty much just use it for drums and I like making complex beats.
nm-106	So 4 isn’t really cutting it anymore and piano roll editing drums kind of sucks in my opinion.
nm-106	Is there a way to make the step sequencer into 8th or 16th notes in FL?
nm-107	I’m not a trans man, but I am interested in knowing someone’s perspectives who has lived both as a woman and as a man.
nm-107	(Not a lot of people get to experience what it is like to be perceived as both genders)
nm-107	So that’s kind of neat in my opinion.
nm-108	I don’t think he did the role justice.
nm-108	I feel before Neo figured it out, the way he was speaking was ok, but after… in my opinion, he should have gone full Hugo Weaving speech.
nm-109	I just wanted to share my opinion not being a United fan, on the game against Burnley.
nm-109	(Not that many of you will care).
nm-109	McTominay - sheesh, what a guy.
nm-109	I thought that Shaw was solid.
nm-109	Now you’ve got two good left backs in good form.
nm-109	Also I wanted to say AWB had a much better game, I thought.
nm-109	After the shitty games and Dalot playing well I personally thought AWB improved a lot.
nm-110	I would be fine if it was changed to tome can only drop at 4-6,
nm-110	Yes this also ties into the item drop timing issues, but for me I can live with those issues but not this.
nm-110	Please change!
nm-111	It’s kind of an odd question in my opinion, but I have a ball python who I just got to eat frozen/thawed for the first time (yay!), but she seems to prefer medium rats.
nm-111	I’ve tried frozen/thawed large rats with no success.
nm-111	First medium I offer and I got her to eat.
nm-111	It could be a fluke though.
nm-112	I know it’s like a meme or something of “Dark Souls player complains about the combat” or something similar, but I just don’t get the combat.
nm-112	I can do DS3 Deathless, I know how to parry at about above average skill, I have played a shit ton of Ghost of Tsushima lately.
nm-112	I know it’s not a difficult game, but hear me out real quick if you know the game.
nm-113	Oh my God!
nm-113	Why do so many morons try to download PC game torrents when firstly they don’t have any idea of how a torrent even works (it’s so damn easy though!).
nm-113	Comments like “The link doesn’t work”, rofl!
nm-113	Yes, it works completely fine!
nm-113	You’re just way too dumb to know you need a torrent program.
nm-114	😤 Idiot morons 😡😡🤬
nm-115	So I get tipped on the app, they gave me cash at the door, then took away the tip on the application after?
nm-115	What the fuck is even the point of that?
nm-115	This shit has never happened before, but now it’s happened 3 times this week.
nm-115	Once the cash tip was less than the app tip...
nm-115	If you are tipping both, tip both.
nm-116	Not going to lie, Teamfight Tactics is a good mode, but it’s like Hearthstone a good game to play on your phone, not something to grind out all day all night, like what the fuck?
nm-116	It’s not even that engaging (ideal game to turn on, prep up and alt tab until it’s next time you can do anything).
nm-116	Any thoughts?
nm-117	I know it’s a scientific things and all, but some of the posts there are just too much.
nm-117	Learning dream languages?
nm-117	What the fuck?
nm-117	And some bloke is saying “I tried the 3 jump and eat banana method but didn’t lucid dream?!” every few hours.
nm-117	Maybe the posts are just getting a little too imaginative?
nm-118	Like everyone is gathered and shows fake smile, fake dance, fake love and I am like “Dear lord, what the fuck is happening, ooh”.
nm-119	So I am a first time cup user, and I got the Saalt cup at Target.
nm-119	I decided to do a dry run in the shower today, and it went in pretty fine after a few different fold methods were attempted (C-fold + 17 year-old virgin = ow).
nm-119	I got it in with the 7-fold, and it may not have been perfect but a great first try.
nm-119	I go to take it out and how the fuck am I supposed to do this with my long ass acrylic nails?
nm-119	In one way, it kind of helped me find the cup lowkey grip, but god damn was it difficult trying not to stab myself.
nm-120	I didn’t think about nails...
nm-121	Is he going to tell her?
nm-121	If so how would that conversation go down?!
nm-122	Okay, what the fuck! Arlo now knows Sera (I don’t know how to spell her full name) is John’s weakness.
nm-123	First of all, we’ve seen they are greedy as fuck (OK, not as much other mobile studios, but still).
nm-123	Second, the game needs a lot of work to work well (even if it was designed for high-end phones).
nm-123	Even that (oh, Allah may forgive me) damn Fornite mobile is better optimized nowadays.
nm-124	What the fuck are you Yanks on?
nm-125	See also:
nm-125	(on an article about how it’s “40 degrees in some parts of Europe”)
nm-125	> what the fuck, lol, that’s not hot at all.
nm-125	Put on a jacket, dummies!
nm-125	(“[city] experiences average annual temperatures of 16°C”)
nm-125	> Oh my God, that’s really cold.
nm-125	I’m never moving to canada.
nm-126	Sometimes it will cause me to have racing thoughts, others it chills me the fuck out and gives me nods similar to codeine.
nm-126	Why the hell is this?
nm-126	I think it has something to do with whether or not a woman looks at me and thinks I’m ugly.
nm-126	If that happens, I get anxious from it.
nm-126	But if a women looks at me and feels indifferent and even thinks I’m decent looking, I get good effects from the stuff.
nm-126	What the fuck is going on?
nm-127	If you shoot an enemy then crouch to become invisible, even if they don’t detect you, they will waltz right over to exactly where you are.
nm-127	Sneak is garbage in this game.
nm-127	I should’ve just grabbed a submachine gun and power armor.
nm-128	I finally beat him after so many tries, most of them being on his second phase.
nm-128	His 3rd phase I beat first time.
nm-129	I got 7th place on the last event with Magaki but have 2960 points and get 50 frags instead of 80 for 7-10 place.
nm-129	Why?
nm-129	Because I have less than 3000 points.
nm-129	(I need 55 Magaki frags and I get 50 - just feel my suffering)
nm-129	Also in another event with gamer764 I have around 8000 points and got 4th place and got rewards for 4th place, not for 1st.
nm-129	What is it with needing 7k points or more?
nm-129	Are the developers too greedy?
nm-130	I made plans to go camping during a day we were going to see each other, and I got a bunch of texts on how she wished I was still free Wednesday, and so I canceled it, and now she won’t stop saying sorry that’s not what she meant.
nm-130	What the fuck do I do?
nm-130	I told her I was going on another one next month (lie) to make her feel better, but I didn’t.
nm-131	But I don’t necessarily need top of the line if that also means the light will be heavy and bulky.
nm-131	I prefer high speed, low drag equipment.
nm-131	Would prefer to use AA batteries rather than being tethered to 16850s.
nm-131	Can you recommend something?
nm-131	Thanks!
nm-132	Okay, so I’ve got less than a chapter left in Gardens of the Moon and I still can’t understand what the fuck Oponn is trying to achieve through all their/its meddling.
nm-132	Is there something I’m missing, is it continued in another book, or is it just a dead end?
nm-133	It actually got like 7 updoots.
nm-133	You all are whack.
nm-134	What the fuck! I posted a literal anime foot and still didn’t even make most controversial post of the day, let alone of all time.
nm-135	So huh, you can’t alpha Karthus ult?
nm-135	What the fuck is this bullshit?
nm-136	It would be very helpful if all of you original posters out there actually said what the fuck it was that everyone is talking about before going on a banter about it!
nm-136	Such as “now I understand why this [brand name] thing has everyone going crazy”…
nm-136	To someone that is not constantly in the loop about the different changes, that doesn’t mean much to me.
nm-136	If it’s too long to type, reference the original post, news article, video, whatever at the beginning of your post.
nm-137	And the scary thing, I am not in the “DFW teams are cursed” camp or a #FireJD type.
nm-137	However, some of this stuff is bugging me too much.
nm-137	When Corey Perry being signed by the Stars is not the biggest potential what the fuck transaction among DFW teams, that is a bad sign.
nm-138	I’m building a PC, but in the meantime I’m using a crappy 13-year-old PC.
nm-138	I got money for Rust, bought it and it took 4 hours to download, 1 hour to load and 5 hours to load a server.
nm-138	After I hit a tree with my rock, my game crashed.
nm-138	At this time it was 12:47 am and I just said fuck it and went to bed ready for a whole lot of shit today.
nm-139	EM opens the door: May I help you?
nm-139	Me: Yes! Why did you give your kid permission to enter my house without my permission?
nm-139	EM: GT just wanted Smores and to find treasure.
nm-139	GT pulls out one of the treasures from his backpack.
nm-139	My girlfriend’s face just turned red, because the treasure he found was her dildo.
nm-139	My girlfriend snatches that out of GT’s hand.
nm-139	GF: This isn’t meant for kids.
nm-139	GT: But it’s mine - I found it and finders keepers.
nm-139	EM: Give him back his treasure.
nm-139	Me: Why the fuck are you not watching your son, EM, because he has embarrassed my girlfriend and entered my home without permission.
nm-140	Stop!
nm-140	Me: Yes, ma’am.
nm-140	EM: What are you listening to?
nm-140	Me: Better Off Dead from Josh A.
nm-140	EM: What?!
nm-140	EK: mom, stop!
nm-140	Me: Bett-
nm-140	EM: I heard you. What is that cover? *points to album cover*
nm-140	Me: Oh, I think that’s a reference to cu-
nm-140	EM: *cuts me off again* to satanic ritual.
nm-140	Me: No, not at all.
nm-140	EK: Mom, please stop!
nm-140	EM: No, EK, this is a bad man.
nm-140	EM (to me): Now give me your phone.
nm-140	It was at this moment I knew this was a entitled parent.
nm-140	Me: No.
nm-140	EM: But my EK needs it. He’s got his degree.
nm-140	EK: Mom, I’m 10.
nm-140	Me: *coughs* Damn!
nm-140	EM: How dare you swear in front of my son?
nm-140	Yes, she said that damn was a cuss.
nm-140	Me: Damn is not a cuss word.
nm-141	She left for another dude (a player), has strung me along this whole time pretty much and been hot and cold.
nm-141	Now she’s on to another guy as of the end of March and is currently on vacation with him for 9 days in another state.
nm-141	However, she takes the same bike trail as me (the only one) for the past few months and we run into each other every couple weeks and have small talk.
nm-141	About a week and a half ago, we talked for well over an hour on the trail.
nm-141	Kind of disrespectful to the new boyfriend, huh?
nm-141	We get along and she told me happy birthday on May 3rd.
nm-141	However, I will not be wishing her one today.
nm-141	Birthdays are a big deal to her, but I can’t think of a reason why I should…
nm-142	After going “uh no?”, she sends me a picture of said candle holder from her kitchen.
nm-142	I of course go “what the fuck, you’re home?”, and it turns out she left an hour ago from the hospital.
nm-142	No updates.
nm-142	No phonecall.
nm-142	So I’m beyond pissed that I was even concerned for three days.
nm-142	TLDR: sickly narcisstic mom went into hospital for 3 days.
nm-142	I find out she’s home because of a candle holder.
nm-143	It’s been a few years and I don’t care to look back so long as we can be happy together, but it’s really hard for her.
nm-143	The thing that hurts her the most is that I let her go through my phone after finding the nudes and there was a message I sent to someone on Facebook in response to her calling me beautiful because of a song I made that I was sharing.
nm-143	I was very flirtatious, maybe more so than I was with my girlfriend when I was first talking to her, and that has been echoing in my girlfriend’s mind.
nm-143	It’s been extremely difficult for her.
nm-143	We have two dogs now.
nm-143	I was hoping us having two puppies to love would help draw her back to being in love with me again, because we have them to bond over, but she still can’t say “I love you too”.
nm-143	She doesn’t accept when I try to give her compliments, because I’ve said rude things in the past when I used to drink (2 years ago).
nm-144	You can try fancy elaborate games, but if you stink and dress like shit, best of luck to you, but I don’t see it happening.
nm-144	Working as a waiter has definitely forced me to up my grooming by trimming my nails, wearing Versace Crystal Noir and other fragrances etc., which I believe is the reason why most girls, even if they’re taken, at least are willing to have a conversation with me.
nm-144	Rejection is the ultimate tool for self-development, and even though I’ve been shot down by countless numbers of women in my life, I never let it get me down and I’m so proud of myself for even having the confidence to speak to these women, even though I may not have Hollywood good looks or charisma like Will Smith xD.
nm-144	You guys are all beautiful and I wish you all the best of success with finding your companions :-)
nm-145	She’s 18 inches long and weighs 56 grams at 15 months.
nm-145	I’m just curious if this is a pretty average growth rate for females or is she growing really fast?
nm-145	She eats like an absolute champion every 4-5 days and she’s already longer than some males get, so I’m curious!
nm-146	The anime is about a main character that’s in a game, but she doesn’t realise it, but the system says she’s dead and etc.
nm-146	I would like to watch the rest of it, so please help me.
nm-147	Looking for an anime.
nm-148	I don’t know if to others it’s strange, but to me it was.
nm-148	I got Covid by kissing another guy for the first time, so I had to tell my mum.
nm-148	I could’ve just lied and said it was because of sharing cups or kissing a girl, since I’m bi-sexual, but I knew my parents would be accepting...
nm-148	So I told them as it was.
nm-148	My mum was very disappointed, because she thought she knew me well, and though I told her everything, but now she couldn’t trust me anymore, because blah blah blah…
nm-148	Basically, he was very disappointed in me, and actually took time to convince her that I didn’t feel like telling her, because it’s private to me... until today.
nm-148	She doesn’t really trust me like before, but she’s ok, lol.
nm-149	Today it’s my birthday, so I’m sharing my “strange” coming out story.
nm-150	So me and my friend started playing Valorant again and want us to learn communications such as heaven and all of that.
nm-150	Now I know what heaven is, but I don’t know others, and if there is a website I would be happy to have to look at it :D
nm-150	(If you’re still confused, I’ll give a scenario: “I hit the Jett, she’s in heaven”, like the location.
nm-151	She’s an awesome cook, does all the grocery shopping.
nm-151	My aunt and I will be helping out too, but she’s not a good cook either, lol.
nm-151	So I want to make their lives easier by meal prepping, and to make sure my mom is eating well.
nm-151	She can’t be eating junk recovering!
nm-152	(I got this a lot where a girl gets hired and I have to help them, they are always rude to me for no reason, unless the woman is older or it’s a guy)
nm-152	She’s all nice and sweet to everyone else, but she’s just rude to me.
nm-152	She will take credit from me and blame me when stuff goes wrong (not to my face).
nm-152	The moment she is around guys and other people, she belittles me.
nm-152	She talks good about herself, takes my credit then blames me when something goes wrong and everyone in my department goes along with it., which is wrong.
nm-152	When she is there, she doesn’t do any work and clowns around with the guys but only when the managers aren’t there.
nm-152	The worst part about it is that people really like her and think me and her are close friends.
nm-153	The “false advertising” on the A4 passive is very easy to understand if you just read the whole skill, where it says multiple buffs can’t co-exist.
nm-153	Maybe I’m the only one, but I think this is all dumb and also kills a lot of people’s excitement.
nm-153	I don’t like to hear people freaking out for no reason over a five star, lol.
nm-153	It’s just like Zhongli.
nm-153	He was fine, but everyone freaked, because he wasn’t doing enough to dumpster content and was balanced.
nm-154	I’ve seen lots of people in the fandom make rude or racist comments about Liberty and it’s disgusting.
nm-154	Please leave her alone.
nm-154	And you do realize she’s black?
nm-154	Stop making fun of the actors’ ethnic features.
nm-154	It’s honestly rude and not cute.
nm-154	There is nothing wrong with her lips or having big lips in general.
nm-154	It’s not even funny.
nm-154	Honestly, it’s just sick and not cool to behave like that.
nm-154	And it’s not even just Liberty. I’ve seen people talk about Sav and also Jimmy’s hair.
nm-154	(Also moderators, please don’t take this down.
nm-154	I really want people to see it, and I have done nothing wrong.
nm-154	I’ve been having some of my posts randomly deleted for no reason)
nm-155	(As simple as removing the salad and remaking it without guacamole.)
nm-155	She then told me we gave her less meat, when I brought back the same plate without guacamole.
nm-156	She’s home for the first time!
nm-157	She’s finally back!
nm-158	I am making this because of one reason only.
nm-158	I have to keep my puppy in her crate at night, because if I don’t she will poop on the floor.
nm-158	So there’s already 6-8 hours of her being inactive.
nm-158	Then I have work, which is again 6-8 hours.
nm-158	I have to keep my Corgi in my bathroom at this time, because if I don’t, she will reek havoc unsupervised.
nm-159	Am I the asshole for starting a fight with an old friend (strong swearing)?
nm-160	So me and my crush were on a group chat on Snapchat with my friend.
nm-160	Me and my friend were arguing as a “joke” and then she said she preferred older guys, and my friend was (M14), and I said I’m a year older than you, and she says “what I mean by older guys, I mean aged 17” and it hurt my heart.
nm-160	TLDR: My crush says she prefers dudes who are 17 years old and I’m 16 and she’s 15 and it broke me down.
nm-161	Hello I am new on here, but I don’t know if I am the butthole or entitled one this story.
nm-161	This is short, but I was expecting to get a tattoo for my 18th birthday like any 18-year-old, but I wanted to go to this one shop that my brother goes to.
nm-161	I sent a direct message to the artist I wanted, but nothing for 2 months.
nm-161	Like yeah, I understand they are booked for summer tattoos, but at least say “Hey I am booked for the rest of ____”.
nm-161	But I was like “ok, well I am going to look at another artist’s work from this shop that does small tattoos.”
nm-161	Same thing happens: no answer.
nm-161	So me and my brother decide “ok, let’s go to the shop and ask, then we will at least get a answer”.
nm-161	We go, and this young girl attends to us. Let’s call her Brenda.
nm-161	I told her everything.
nm-161	Brenda said “well you can do the tattoo with me”.
nm-161	I said “I’ll be back. I’ll think about it”.
nm-161	I got back in the car and scrolled through her work.
nm-161	It was good work, so I went back and told her “yeah let’s do this”.
nm-161	I signed everything.
nm-161	She didn’t even ask for ID, which I found weird, because I had gotten my piercings done by the same shop and they needed to have ID on records and so on.
nm-161	I brushed it off, since she’s new and all.
nm-161	She worked on me for an hour, told me all the necessary tattoo care stuff and said after 3 or 4 weeks to let her know if there need to be fixes and that it was on her.
nm-161	I was like “ok, great, thanks!”
nm-161	4 weeks passed and there were a lot of mistakes made, because I got a small tattoo heartbeat with a “;” in the middle, but the period on top was a small heart.
nm-161	The right side of the heart was smaller then the other side, and some of the lines were thick to thin then broke to thick again.
nm-162	So I reset it, and yeah oops, I was doing it wrong all this time.
nm-162	Did anyone else kick it away and get mad it wasn’t dying?
nm-163	Then afterwards she began to text very dry, and like through text she kind of sounded mad.
nm-163	I texted her in the night yesterday asking if she’s mad, and like she said she’s only a bit let down.
nm-163	I was really confused afterwards as she began to drag text me, and like I apologized to her and she said its alright.
nm-163	Then I just told her I’m going to sleep, and she just left my message on delivered and, like, she didn’t reply until today.
nm-164	How to tell whether she’s mad at me or just annoyed, because right now I’m really confused?
nm-165	Would I be the asshole if I was just a bigger sarcastic asshole to another asshole?
nm-166	Her tumors are beginning to open through her skin, she won’t jump, painkillers don’t help, she ate a lot yesterday but won’t eat or drink today, she hid most the day, but... it’s hard, because she’s alert.
nm-166	It feels wrong, because she looks at me like “I love you.
nm-166	I’m happy you’re here with me.”
nm-166	But the vet said she wasn’t even supposed to live this long, and the tumors will only get worse, and even if we had done chemotherapy, it would have only prolonged it.
nm-167	My friend told my girlfriend something.
nm-167	She then broke up with me.
nm-167	I don’t know what to do now, because she and the ex-friend were the only people that I had.
nm-167	What should I do to try and regain my relationship, because she’s helped me through a lot over our 2 years of dating?
nm-167	TLDR: My girlfriend broke up with me because of something someone said, and I want to regain my relationship with my girlfriend.
nm-168	He waited for me to leave to fire someone who has been a dedicated employee, because she’s a person of color with tattoos and “fits the part” of someone he considered would be on drugs.
nm-168	It makes me sick.
nm-168	I reported all this high up, because I need to protect my staff, but I’m worried that this will turn around and bite me.
nm-169	My ex loves kids.
nm-169	She was playing Captain Save a Hoe, almost caught a domestic case over this woman’s situation with this girl’s “crazy” baby daddy.
nm-169	They moved fast.
nm-169	They were in each other’s life.
nm-169	It hasn’t even been two months!
nm-169	I’m so hurt.
nm-169	She never wanted to build a life with me.
nm-169	I knew she would be all in if I had a kid on me.
nm-170	They’ve grown out to the point they look kind of awkward, and she’s saying I should get them filled, but would it be weird or bad (like for my nails) or anything to ask about getting them completely redone with something I’d like better?
nm-171	Aah!
nm-171	She said she might have some clothes that fit me.
nm-171	I’m dying!
nm-171	She’s so supportive and nice, oh my God!
nm-172	So, it’s 0:34 the first of January while posting this, and my sister (F14) just ruined my New Year by calling my mum fat and telling her she’s a drinker when she poured herself a glass of champagne, which she only does on her birthday on Christmas Eve and on New year.
nm-172	Now my parents are pissed off, my grandparents are pissed off, and my sister thinks she was funny.
nm-172	The same thing happened on Christmas Eve, and now the whole feeling of New Year is gone and I hate my sister.
nm-172	P.S. English is my second language so sorry for my spelling.
nm-173	Screw INTJ’s.
nm-173	Why have they got to be good at everything?
nm-174	It was a mistake getting the booster the day before New Year’s.
nm-174	I feel like absolute dog water.
nm-175	Literally most of today we spent cuddling and talking about random shit and I almost cried 🙏
nm-175	I’m so happy, bro.
nm-175	She’s so cool.
nm-175	I’m going to ask her to be my girlfriend at midnight :-)
nm-175	Also, happy New Year’s Eve and happy New Year everyone!
nm-176	First of all, the satisfaction I get from saying I am the manager when customers ask for one is amazing.
nm-176	A high I’ll never come off of.
nm-176	Second of all, a customer comes in for the second time, mad because I didn’t do copies from a book because of copyright.
nm-176	She goes “well, I called customer service and they said you were not supposed to reject me like that”.
nm-176	And I’m like ??, ma’am it’s in our policy.
nm-176	I don’t care what customer service says.
nm-176	She keeps on being rude and yapping then throws the book on the counter and goes “make my copy”.
nm-176	Like, lol, not when you act rude like that.
nm-177	Our cat is getting fixed on the 11th, and she’s such a cuddly, loving, little girl and I love her cuddles every night and in the morning.
nm-177	I’m just scared that she isn’t going to be like that after she gets fixed.
nm-177	Am I overthinking it?
nm-177	Do you think since she’s in the habit now and loves cuddles and such she’ll do it all her life?
nm-178	Me and my partner have this running joke that I don’t fart.
nm-178	It started out as a joke after I told her that as an answer to a truth or dare question on our first date.
nm-178	Recently she’s been asking me if I’ll fart in front of her.
nm-178	She says her friends have all heard their partners fart and it’s weird she’s never heard me do it.
nm-179	I can’t believe she saying I’m depressed looking while she’s such a shy girl and weird thinking she’s not.
nm-179	So delusional.
nm-179	I hate it, but they are my only friends.
nm-179	She’s calling me cringe without a reason...
nm-180	My friends are mean and delusional.
nm-180	One is immature and shy and always pulling me down.
nm-180	The other is fine, just jealous, and it’s getting on my nerves.
nm-180	What to do?
nm-181	This is a setup I can live with.
nm-181	My boyfriend’s and my fear however is that in a few years when we’re ready to settle down, Gina will be wanting to move in and be long term with her own boyfriend.
nm-181	I’m very stuck.
nm-181	I love my boyfriend and desperately want to keep his system happy.
nm-181	But I am not going to allow any more pushing of the boundaries.
nm-181	What do I do here?
nm-182	Boundary Issues with my boyfriend’s alter.
nm-183	She was super keen for a second date and we arranged a location but not a date, due to the Christmas holidays.
nm-183	I appreciate it’s a busy period for people, so our responses were like 1 per day.
nm-183	She was up-front when we met and said she’s shit at texting, and has apologised when we were speaking for slow replies, something to which I said “don’t worry, I know you’re busy!”
nm-183	The conversation seems to flow well, lots of questions from her side in the conversation.
nm-183	However, I’ve not received a response for 3 days (unread), but she’s viewed my story and posted a story since.
nm-183	It was New Year’s Eve.
nm-184	So I was all ready for the New Year actually thinking positive and the changes I’m going to make, etc.
nm-184	Then I see he’s posted a picture of them both that she’s taken saying “love of my life”.
nm-184	It destroyed me.
nm-184	He also put a status about 2022 being a special one.
nm-184	Talk about rubbing it in my face!
nm-185	Ex’s boyfriend posted a picture of them :-(
nm-186	Every time I ask other people for advice on this situation, they all tell me that she’s probably insecure and looks up to me (even though she’s older, what the fuck?) and that I shouldn’t blame her for the way she feels.
nm-186	I cannot deal with her.
nm-186	She drains the life out of me.
nm-186	I cannot talk about anything without her either trying to copy me or compete with me.
nm-186	Recently I’ve been losing weight, and our family members noticed and commented on it.
nm-186	In the corner of my eye, I could see her getting uncomfortable and then obviously she brought herself up and started talking about her accomplishments.
nm-187	We agree to separate as our marriage was hitting a nose dive in general.
nm-187	2 months later, we get back together.
nm-187	We do intensive therapy and things seem to be great.
nm-187	I’m so happy.
nm-187	In our anniversary month, what do I see on his phone Snapchat?
nm-187	I look at it again, I see Jane, but this time I can look at their conversation history throughout this whole year and last.
nm-188	So I just got my first bearded dragon.
nm-188	He’s only a month old, and like most new owners, I’m worried about if he or she is not eating enough.
nm-188	I try to feed him in periods throughout the day, but so far I’ve only been able to feed him about 6-7 crickets.
nm-188	I’ve tried feeding him some vegetables too, but the guy doesn’t show any interest in them.
nm-188	Is there anything I’m doing wrong or is he just fine and I’m overly worried?
nm-189	Then I found out about this really cool website called Complex.
nm-189	They’re sort of like journalism but better, since they’re all about hip hop.
nm-189	I found out about Travis Scott through Complex.
nm-189	Before, I listened to trash artists with no aesthetic, but Travis Scott made me realize that aesthetic is really important.
nm-189	Now I like Tame Impala, and I’ve started dressing weirder, I bought my first pair of joggers last week and hopefully I’ll wear them soon.
nm-190	Is it just me cringing at the Twitter posts by Albatross?
nm-190	Everyone who knows who he is knows his stance.
nm-190	He’s making it seem like XVG is a sinking ship at the moment, and it’s doing fine.
nm-191	So I have this friend in real life.
nm-191	Man, the dude is known everywhere.
nm-191	He’s got a solid reputation on the streets, in the jails. Everywhere this guy goes, everyone knows him.
nm-191	He was trying to explain to me how to get more karma on Reddit, because I feel like I’m not really known.
nm-192	How do you get hella karma?
nm-193	I’m 21, he’s about to be 23.
nm-193	My issue is that he seems to have no ambition anymore.
nm-193	He doesn’t work and doesn’t make an effort to finish school, even small trade schools for a certification as an EMT.
nm-193	He failed it the first time by 2 points, and I think he fears failure so he doesn’t really want to try anything anymore.
nm-193	He’s been unemployed for over a year now and failed that school almost a year ago.
nm-194	I’ve gotten Super Smough about 5 times, but I always get stuck in his nuclear butt bomb aura.
nm-194	I swear I’m far enough away, but it still shocks me in 1 hit.
nm-194	I’m using a 2H battle axe +10 gargoyle helms and naked (even with tattered armor it doesn’t seem to make a difference) Chloranthy ring and ring of steel protection.
nm-194	Any tips?
nm-194	I know by throwing myself at them enough times I’ll get them, but it’s slowly wearing at my sanity.
nm-194	I know what to do, but I seem to always get caught in a dumb combination or something.
nm-195	I bet you didn’t bother reading the whole number, or notice the letter I put in there, and now you’ll go back to check only to realize there was no letter.
nm-195	What I if also told you you read this sentence wrong too?
nm-195	Well, now that I have your attention!
nm-195	I hope you’ll carefully read through the rest of this post :-)
nm-196	19/F Aw shit, here we go again for the 7754378435116th time.
nm-197	If I just want to make Draven my 1 carry, how should I do it?
nm-197	I know he’s a good unit, but what items can turn him into a god?
nm-197	I tried healing sword and rapid fire cannon, but I get lost after that.
nm-198	Atlus is a great character.
nm-198	However, his shield’s gun is overpowered and his rewind ability is somewhat annoying.
nm-198	However the most annoying thing is his shield.
nm-198	If you place down the shield and just use it to stop bullets that’s fine.
nm-198	However I was playing as Skye today and threw my ult at his shield.
nm-198	It did not activate, because it got absorbed.
nm-198	I don’t know about other players’ opinions, but I believe that Atlus should be nerfed a good bit so he’s not overpowered enough to counter everything.
nm-198	Tell me what you people think.
nm-199	I didn’t think anything of it, so when I went to give the last cookies on the shelf to him, the entitled kid started screaming “Mommy, he stole my cookies!”
nm-199	At first I was startled.
nm-199	I started to get nervous, and I froze.
nm-199	Then entitled parent walks up and starts yelling “Give those cookies back to my daughter! Give them back!”
nm-199	And I did not know what to say at first, but then something came to mind: just say “but I didn’t.”
nm-199	But the way I said it was so cautious.
nm-199	Then my sister takes the cookies from my hands and handed them to my dad.
nm-199	That’s when my dad noticed (he’s old — sad he didn’t realise a little bit earlier)
nm-199	He called a manager to the scene, and the manager told us to continue and he’ll deal with it.
nm-200	We broke up 2 months ago.
nm-200	We had very little contact.
nm-200	But tomorrow I’m no longer putting up with it.
nm-200	He would be the one to reach out all the time.
nm-200	I never reached out first.
nm-200	And if I answered, it was only about the class he was paying me to do.
nm-200	He is still on my car insurance, and he messaged me on Friend asking what was going on with it.
nm-200	I answered the next day and said I didn’t change anything.
nm-200	After that part of the conversation ended, I asked him how he was doing about the death of his dog.
nm-200	(He is deployed and his dog was his world)
nm-200	He said that he’s good when he doesn’t think about it and how he told his mom to cremate him, etc.
nm-201	Day 1 of no contact starts tomorrow.
nm-201	Help.
nm-202	So me and a friend ended up making a poster.
nm-202	We used my name and I’ll credit his Instagram below.
nm-202	He’s a good guy.
nm-202	I’m glad we got both our ideas in the poster for the game and our story.
nm-202	Would you guys like either homemade lore or not?
nm-202	I couldn’t post this on the Fallout Reddit for some reason.
nm-202	It wouldn’t let me put the photo.
nm-202	I hope it’s good, guys!
nm-203	Is it even possible for ITSOKTOCRY to blow up outside of the 3 songs he’s had do extremely well?
nm-203	Like get burst into the mainstream rather than just have a few albums do well then fall off?
nm-204	Me and my friend have been playing Minecraft together for a while, and they made their own server so we can play on it together alone, cool.
nm-204	I have always told my friend how much I despise griefers, because they don’t just destroy something in a game, they destroy hours of work, and it fucking sucks.
nm-204	My friend lately has been really mean to me when we are playing, constantly saying I’m mean if I don’t go half way across the map to give him material that can be easily obtained where he is, literally repeating to me non-stop how I’m “mean” or a “bad person”, because I’m busy doing something so I can’t go give him his shit.
nm-205	Well, I finally get a chance to let loose and have a wine date with a childhood friend of mine that I don’t see often at all.
nm-205	We drink (at my house) while the kids are playing and such.
nm-205	Nothing heavy.
nm-205	We do get slightly tipsy, you know.
nm-205	Towards the end, my husband sends me a Facebook message saying he’s ready for her to leave (she’d been there 2 hours at this point) and then he starts passive-aggressive cleaning in front of us.
nm-206	He’s going through a divorce so he keeps telling me that’s taking all his money.
nm-206	I didn’t give him a title as I didn’t even get one when I bought it.
nm-206	It was salvaged from some guys at a used car lot.
nm-206	They gave me a bill of sale, but I’ve long since lost it.
nm-206	Should take him to court or do you think it’s not worth it?
nm-206	Also, if I did want to how, would I?
nm-207	So I just told this guy in my class, who was also weird as fuck and gave it to him saying “oof, I sat on it. It broke. Do you just want it?”
nm-207	He’s like “no, ew”.
nm-207	I have OCD and immediately got ashamed and was like “lol, why’s it gross?
nm-207	It’s the same as a whole one (and along that line), like, lol, why?”, and he was like “ok, oof, it’s not” and I’m like “lol, why did you say that?”
nm-207	I was saying it jokingly, but I’m afraid I looked weird.
nm-207	Like what the fuck?
nm-207	Why’s she upset or playfully upset that I don’t want it.
nm-208	My human staff comes home tasting of sausages and cheese.
nm-208	I think she has another fluff she is making treats for.
nm-208	Should I be sad or angry?
nm-208	What does your human taste of when they come home?
nm-209	I can tell where your human has been and what they do by taste when they come back?
nm-210	Hey guys, I just wanted to share this helpful application with you all :-D.
nm-210	It’s not that I am trying to promote this application or something.
nm-210	It really helped me a lot.
nm-210	That’s why I thought it might even help you guys out.
nm-210	I’ve seen quite a lot of people struggling to increase their team OVRs, and many are thinking to buy players, but can’t decide which will boost their team OVRs the most.
nm-210	This application helps to calculate the OVR of your team after filling all the players in their respective positions.
nm-210	It is really tough for most people (F2P players) to keep on buying and selling players to decide our team OVR since it will result in a huge loss of coins (because of 10% EA tax).
nm-211	What’s the recommended amount of dedicated RAM I should have to server?
nm-212	If you are reading this, you should be ashamed of yourself.
nm-212	You should be asleep.
nm-212	Go to bed, I say.
nm-213	Once upon a time, there was a girl named Star Butterfly.
nm-213	She had blond hair, blue eyes and a super cute and colorful dress.
nm-213	And she had a magic wand!
nm-213	One day she got kicked out of Mewny (her home dimension) by her mean mom >:-( just because she made a mistake.
nm-213	So she had to go to Earth.
nm-213	On Earth, there was a boy named Marco Diaz.
nm-213	He liked safety and he was super handsome.
nm-213	Everybody at school was in love with him!
nm-213	(Except for that idiot Jackie)
nm-213	So anyway, Star came to the principal’s office.
nm-213	He was like “Star, this is Marco. He’s your guide.”
nm-213	Star looked at Marco and she was shocked.
nm-213	“Wow, you’re so hot.”
nm-213	“lol, thank you” he said, blushing, and he winked.
nm-213	“Let me show you around the school.”
nm-213	“Ok”, said Star.
nm-213	So they walked around school and they became friends.
nm-213	“Ok, since you’re my best friend now, I should probably tell you who I am”, said Star.
nm-213	“I’m a magic princess”.
nm-213	Then she took out her wand and created 667 laser puppies!
nm-214	I have a question for this Reddit.
nm-214	Can you provide honest answers?
nm-214	I currently have a custom build PC with i7 3770k 32g@1666 RAM and single GTX 1080 GPU.
nm-214	Should I get a second one for 650 euros or wait for what upcoming years will bring?
nm-215	GTX 1080 SLI or save money for 11th generation Nvidia xx80 TI GPU?
nm-216	I know a lot about Jailbreak.
nm-216	Should I make a Jailbreak?
nm-217	How many likes can a thoughtless post get as long as I like Telecaster? :l.
nm-217	If you don’t upvote post you hate Telecasters and should die.
nm-217	Thanks, ok.
nm-218	I love Telecasters.
nm-219	We should rename August to October, because he wasn’t released in August.
nm-220	I bought GTA4 for Steam PC and it won’t work.
nm-220	It worked fine for a small year on Windows 7, and now my PC has Windows 10 and it won’t work.
nm-220	I made Social Club and Games for Windows Live accounts, but it won’t work even with accounts.
nm-220	It won’t work even for single player.
nm-220	It won’t work after the people on screen wait in the loading screen.
nm-220	Then suddenly when the game should start, it just closes the window and that’s it.
nm-220	So how make it work ?
nm-221	How do we get them to know they should use it?
nm-221	The only feasible situation I see is a complete and big economic collapse...
nm-221	I want to use it, because I want to control my own destiny and not be robbed by the central banks or the government and I want to feel my own liberty.
nm-221	I do not have even $1 in my bank account, because I don’t want to own debt tokens.
nm-221	I want to own freedom...
nm-221	How do we change the landscape?
nm-221	What are your thoughts?
nm-221	Sorry for my English being bad.
nm-222	I should buy up that limited time bike for Halloween before it disappears next week.
nm-223	Inside your body, deep beneath your skin, muscles, and not beneath your organs, lurks 1 (one) skeleton.
nm-223	Spooky!
nm-223	But wait, it gets worse.
nm-223	The skeleton inside you doesn’t even pay rent!
nm-223	He/she lives in your body so he/she should pay rent!
nm-223	They freeload off you and don’t even do shit for you.
nm-223	So you should evict your spooky boy.
nm-223	Happy Halloween!
nm-223	Edit: I didn’t expect this post to blow up like it has!
nm-223	Thanks for the 6 upvotes!
nm-224	Just small information, I’m 5’9 140lbs male.
nm-224	Currently, my 5k is 1:58.7 and my 2k is a 1:51.1
nm-224	My coach says I should be 1:49 for a 2k, but I really can’t hold a 1:49 for more than 1200 meters before my split just rises to 2:05-2:10.
nm-224	Is 1:49 just my coach being a typical “you should be good, but you’re not, so I’m going to give you unrealistic goals”, or should I be at 1:49?
nm-225	My head hurts when I go krumping heads with other boys!
nm-225	Green lighting things go all over the place too!
nm-225	What should I do, doctors?!
nm-226	Right, so I’ve fixed my headaches!
nm-226	I’ve had to throw up some burny green stuff!
nm-226	The boss says I should do that more on the battle, the place we’ve been fighting in!
nm-226	I’ve got a metal stick for my trouble too!
nm-227	This poem went as follows:
nm-227	> My name is frog,
nm-227	> I like to play,
nm-227	> Out in the rain,
nm-227	> All night and day.
nm-227	> My skin is green,
nm-227	> My face is coy,
nm-227	> You look and say,
nm-227	> Here comes that boy.
nm-227	This was received rather poorly, earning me some disapproving comments.
nm-228	Aren’t you all tired of seeing at least the first two jumping into battle and wiping out your whole team in an instant?
nm-228	I’ve heard somewhere about people saying that if they weren’t here then, well, the game would be balanced.
nm-228	Well, I beg to differ, because there’s Akai with his insane disruption and Diggie with his timely ult or maybe even Irithel might be banned because of her deadly ability to snowball and splash ult.
nm-228	Back to the topic.
nm-228	Honestly, the king and queen of this game are Lancelot and his beloved Fanny.
nm-229	You know, to keep it safe from me in little car where I can go anywhere.
nm-229	And then Mom-O decides to go to the gym to do a quick workout, whatever that is.
nm-229	She says to me, “You leave the steak alone, doggo. You be a good girl!”
nm-229	She tied a plastic bag real tight around the steak.
nm-229	Haha!
nm-229	Then she goes into the gym, and when she come back many forevers later, guess what?
nm-229	Haha!
nm-229	She opens the tiny car and looks at me and looks at the steak bag… and she says, “Good Girl!
nm-229	You left the steak alone!”
nm-229	And that is the story of me being a good girl.
nm-229	Mom-O says she should have brought the steak into the gym and left it on the bench next to her with her sweatshirt.
nm-229	She says she is dumb not to think of that.
nm-229	Maybe Mom-O will get smart in a few forevers.
nm-230	My bed smells like disease.
nm-230	I should probably wash it.
nm-231	Please send me some tips and stuff on what to teach him.
nm-231	Currently he’s doing pretty good, though the only thing he buys is shotguns, because that’s the only gun he gets kills from.
nm-231	I already taught him the basics like planting the spike and things like that.
nm-231	By the way, this is coming from an Iron 3 player (hardstuck, friends say I should be silver and some even say platinum, because I carried a gold player).
nm-232	Do you know how some motherfuckers exist?
nm-232	They literally get close to you, then all of a sudden you have problems, and even though you apologize again and again and again, no it’s never enough for them.
nm-232	I was in a Google Meet, but I told them I’d be back in 10.
nm-232	I forgot my phone so I went to get it, and guess what, them speaking about you and backstabbing you.
nm-232	You seriously don’t know what to do and whom to trust anymore.
nm-232	Maybe I am overthinking, but I’d rather die alone than live among these kind of people.
nm-232	Maybe I should just ignore them?
nm-232	Or should I give them another chance?
nm-232	Or maybe I am just weird, lol.
nm-233	l have developed feelings for my best friend.
nm-233	Now, the question is: should l tell her how l feel about her?
nm-233	Will this affect our relationship that we have?
nm-233	How will she take it?
nm-234	I’ve been waiting for two years now, savings from then and I barely made 200 USD until now.
nm-234	I’m still studying, and gaming is my dream… and these prices are giving me depression and hopelessness from life… to be honest…
nm-234	What should I get?
nm-234	A monitor or a GPU…?
nm-234	Some of you are so lucky to get a GPU for free on here… lol…
nm-235	Am I the asshole? Me (31F) asked my kids dad (43M) to help me finish off stripping wallpaper in the kids’ room so I can finish decorating it.
nm-235	I recently had surgery and am not meant to lift too much or stretch but felt OK and thought I could do it alone.
nm-235	I can’t.
nm-235	I hurt my incisions so asked him to help do the top of the walls where I can’t reach.
nm-235	He said yes and today came to do it.
nm-235	After a bit, he said he was done and leaving.
nm-235	I gave him £20 and said how grateful I am for the help.
nm-235	I checked the room once he left...
nm-235	Both kids’ beds were full of torn off wallpaper, drawers cracked where he stood on them.
nm-235	I’ve still 2 walls left unfinished and have spent the last 45 minutes picking up wallpaper from everything.
nm-235	His kids sleep on these beds.
nm-235	Am I the asshole if I confront him about the mess or should I let it go and not bother asking in future?
nm-236	My boyfriend gets impatient easily and gets annoyed when I ask dumb questions (for example, I didn’t know how to fill my tire and he got annoyed after he explained it once and then said “why is it hard? Just fill it”.
nm-236	So I tried to do it but I failed.
nm-236	Later he was like “babe… it took you an hour to fill your tire?”
nm-236	Then when I do it myself and don’t ask him he goes “why don’t you ask me? I can teach you or help you”, but I refrain from asking, because he gets frustrated.
nm-237	The last couple of calls had arguments, as he got mad, because I beat his ass in video games (even though gaming is his only hobby) and I’ve left wondering if our relationship is worth the trouble.
nm-237	I’ve talked about him to lots of my real life friends, and they all ask why I continue to be his friend, and I can never confidently answer why.
nm-237	But he’s depressed and lonely and wants my attention as I’m one of the only people who actively tries to interact with him online.
nm-238	Yeah I know, my shoes don’t match.
nm-238	They match the graffiti though!
nm-238	I’m trying a lot of different styles, so let me know what I should change.
nm-238	Hat: Sicko by Ian Conner
nm-238	Shoes: Nike
nm-238	Everything else is thrifted.
nm-239	Ok, so I swallowed a small piece of box (?) tape as I was trying to bite it off with my teeth, and then I feel it in my ear 😭 not ear but that hole in my throat that leads to the ear. It’s just stuck there, oh my God 😭😭😭
nm-239	What should I do, lol?
nm-240	She had me live with a woman once named Chi who said similar stuff, and … it’s just dude what…? Heck, it’s weird.
nm-240	So maybe it’s both a sort of a paradox (life is), but I just want to know, honestly, did anyone else feel it?
nm-240	I want a logical explanation please, and if one doesn’t exist, well I mean, because long before… I was “of age” so to speak… for lack of more efficient words that would be appropriate, because I don’t drink, but I’ve…hmm… I’m an adult, let’s put it like that.
nm-240	There’s other stuff out there, but long before that, me and my family saw a UFO.
nm-240	Even my stepdad said he couldn’t think of what else it could’ve been, and me and my friends saw this white hooded thing in a park about 10 feet tall and, like… it doesn’t really scare me, because I think it’s the way life is.
nm-240	Things change.
nm-240	They don’t always have to make sense, and others say that too.
nm-241	Here is an example of two paragraphs written in the alternate spelling system and then in regular spelling:
nm-241	> The North Wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stronger, when a traveller came along wrapped in a warm cloak.
nm-241	They agreed that the one who first succeeded in making the traveller take his cloak off should be considered stronger than the other.
nm-241	Then the North Wind blew as hard as he could, but the more he blew the more closely did the traveller fold his cloak around him; and at last the North Wind gave up the attempt.
nm-241	Then the Sun shined out warmly, and immediately the traveller took off his cloak.
nm-241	And so the North Wind was obliged to confer that the Sun was the stronger of the two.
nm-241	> That quick beige fox jumped in the air over each thin dog under a calm autumn moon.
nm-241	Look out, I shout, for he’s foiled you yet again, creating chaos.
nm-242	Who would win?
nm-242	Please give a detailed explanation.
nm-243	Ares (Greek mythology) vs. Mars (Roman mythology) vs. Svetovid (Slavic mythology) vs. Odin (Norse mythology) vs. The Big Bang (Atheistic mythology).
nm-244	I am very ready.
nm-244	I am very good.
nm-245	I would like to apply for village idiot.
nm-246	Should I get Horizon Zero Dawn or ELEX, because they are the same price right now, so what should I buy?
nm-246	I’m just looking for reason.
nm-246	By the way, I like open world a lot and shooters, e.g. Skyrim, Battlefield, COD, Ark Survival Evolved.
nm-246	So any ideas on what I should be?
nm-246	By the way, I would prefer them really quick.
nm-246	Thanks in advance.
nm-247	Thanks for the suggestions guys.
nm-247	We are going to try to get the AK-477, because someone said it would help, but where do we find it?!
nm-247	Please help with it.
nm-247	We can’t do it alone :-)
nm-248	I reside in Hyderabad, India, currently pursuing my Bachelor’s in computer science.
nm-248	I am a Canadian citizen, but for enrolment it is required to appear for the IELTS exam.
nm-248	Now, the doubt that has arisen is… would my admission be considered international or domestic?
nm-248	On a side note, how hard is it to be admitted to UoT’s computer science program?
nm-248	What would a typical admitted applicant have to get admitted?
nm-249	I would prefer a hardcore clan with a plan. With a strict mentality of how certain things would go down.
nm-249	I mean a clan that always has a goal or target, that also enjoy teamplay.
nm-249	It’s not a necessity, but it would be nice.
nm-249	PM me if you’re interested!
nm-249	By the way, it’s my first post on this subreddit, so I might not have gotten it all down correct.
nm-250	I’ve literally heard people tell me they learnt then forgot the entire Japanese language through anime.
nm-250	I live in a house with a single mother whose first language is Thai and I barely heard English until I was like 4.
nm-250	She would speak in Thai to me yet I don’t know any Thai.
nm-250	You can’t learn Japanese though anime.
nm-250	In fact I watched anime in Thai dubbed as a child.
nm-250	I don’t fucking know shit.
nm-250	Fools thinking they are out here saying “konnichiwa” in style, I’m contacting the authorities.
nm-251	Here’s a question for you.
nm-251	So you know the Panzer, Blue Gitz, the Tau or whatever?
nm-251	So I, being a Mek, notice that they’ve got tanks and stuff that are flying, right, but they’ve not go the flames coming from whatever thrusters keep them in the air.
nm-251	And they don’t make the beautiful roar that thrusters make.
nm-251	I figure some commando would want a flying truck that doesn’t make a noise.
nm-251	It’s a good market strategy.
nm-251	Anyway, the question: “how do I krump gravity without a sound?”
nm-252	Construction: teleport to house, for when they work on making player-owned houses useful, this would be godly to have.
nm-252	Heck! Even now, player-owned houses has a permanent dummy for adrenaline building, prayer altar, and if they make it like Old School RuneScape, where you can teleport outside any player-owned house portal, this cape would be used a lot.
nm-252	Hitpoints: Heal from regeneration ability increased, current perk I doubt would be used at either bossing or slayer.
nm-252	This one is used at slayer at least.
nm-253	I got one of my annual minds.com token ads in my mail today (I of course unsubscribed as soon as I found the option) and thought “hey, what the heck, let’s make a visit on the supposedly “alternative Facebook” that I just recently got denied for having a “non-believable name” and waiting further ID specification before I can use it again.”
nm-253	And so I did and found out on the 2nd or 3rd post that The AJ Show has been blocked on YouTube,
nm-253	I’m not a fan of rightwing stuff and was actually the reason I stopped watching it 2 years ago, though the small fragrance of freedom was that hard to find among the 90% national-capitalism the site has to offer, but anyhow, I got the idea of a non-censoring video site like LiveLeak but much more simple and less “newsy” that anyone can post on. No content would be removed ❤️
nm-254	Hi guys.
nm-254	I’m at 1500 hours right now, and my instructor still doesn’t let me solo.
nm-254	I think I’m doing my manoeuvres ok, but the instructor says I still need more practice. I’ve tried my manoeuvres on a flight simulator, and my friend captain says that I should stop sending him videos of me playing GTA on my computer at 1 in the morning, although I trained hard on my flight manoeuvres.
nm-254	What should I do?
nm-254	I’m literally crying and shaking right now.
nm-254	My friend would never do that :-(
nm-255	Why don’t they make like Sesame Street for the kids, yo?
nm-255	Like, it is very educational, I think kids would learn a lot from it.
nm-256	I’m kind of hoping to find a place that doesn’t charge those exorbitant commission and all the extras.
nm-256	I have some questions and hope someone can help answer.
nm-256	1. I saw some ads on Shooroq... no commission, etc.
nm-256	Are there any hidden costs I need to be vary about?
nm-256	2. Is there enough parking for the second car?
nm-256	3. How much would the DEWA charges for a 1BHK come to?
nm-256	4. Any other areas I should look for in Dubai that has reasonable rent ?
nm-256	It’s a bit unnerving to manage expenses on 1 person’s salary in this place...
nm-256	I appreciate any advice I get.
nm-257	Bones says something like “switchblade on my waist don’t test”, and it was old young teenage bones, and the beat was hella mellow.
nm-257	I would really appreciate this.
nm-258	Finally it’s giving me an internet connection, but the only problem is, it’s so slow.
nm-258	It’s capable of loading like Google, but anything else just times out.
nm-258	And for some reason I can’t access my router admin page.
nm-258	Really weird.
nm-258	It’s just a white screen or it times out loading it, or the page becomes unresponsive!
nm-258	Help would be appreciated, thank you!
nm-259	Hey all, so today I was in the group chat with friends, and like four of them were roasting the fuck out of me, and at first it was funny, then my ego and self-respect got crippled after building it up for a couple days.
nm-259	Haha, fun.
nm-259	Yes, I know I am lonely and won’t get a girlfriend, but you don’t need to be jerk like that, haha.
nm-260	Hi there, it’s good to see you again!
nm-260	*sits down*
nm-260	How have you been?
nm-260	*cuts a potato with my sacrificial dagger*
nm-260	Wow, that’s great to hear.
nm-260	*adds 12kg of salt*
nm-260	Hm, there we go.
nm-260	*throws a handful over my left shoulder for the devil*
nm-260	Ok good, let’s eat.
nm-260	*removes a small flask from my jacket and pours blood from it onto my plate in a small thick puddle*
nm-260	Haha, that’s the good stuff right there.
nm-260	*chomp chomp*
nm-260	Do you want some? No?
nm-260	Ok good *eats a spoonful of salt*
nm-260	Oh! This is crunchy.
nm-260	*chews and spits out bones*
nm-260	Huh *licks lips*
nm-260	Welp, that was wonderful, I’m pooped.
nm-260	*gets up*
nm-260	Thanks for having me over!
nm-260	*transforms into a bat and flies away*
nm-261	I’m feeling sad, but it’s okay I guess. Because medicines will help help us all.
nm-261	Thank you, have a good morning and good night and good evening Truman show, haha.
nm-262	Just kidding.
nm-262	It’s going to be just as shitty if not worse than last year.
nm-263	All these skin mods and such, how’s it being done?
nm-263	I’d like to try it.
nm-263	Is it player-side only?
nm-264	Mods? How are people modding Battlefront 2 or is it Photoshop?
nm-265	Hi, I was wondering whether or not it is worth dropping some money on pets.
nm-265	Like, I saw how much some people can spend on them to get good results (like T4), and I wouldn’t want to spend that much :-D.
nm-265	Currently, I have 5 T1 pets, and I wouldn’t mind seeing some increase in their looting speed, but I wonder if dropping “just” $100 would be worth it.
nm-266	Is it worth dropping $100 on pets?
nm-267	Towards the end of senior year and that summer, I don’t know what happened, but I got a hot body and my face was all “girl, you’ve been through some shit. Have a gift”, so now I’m pretty.
nm-267	I just made a post on a different subreddit about having a nice date today, which is nice, but I am very hesitant on making friends and stuff because of the last two years.
nm-267	So like, after my glow up or whatever, more people started talking to me, yeah.
nm-267	And a lot of boys did too!
nm-267	I never really had very many friends, so this was a huge yay!
nm-267	The first boy I hung out with was really nice, but then we got high and I did very regrettable things I do not like.
nm-267	Well, that boy was super happy and told lots of boys.
nm-268	I don’t want to jinx it and call them out by name, but I’m talking with a company and I’m hoping it works out!
nm-268	I’m excited about all things I’ll be able to do with these free promo products to help other people and possibly get them off some or all of their Rx drugs!
nm-268	I’m excited for myself, because I have a bunch of medical issues that I do not use Rx drugs for and the other stuff I buy is expensive.
nm-268	This sponsorship will help me, it will help me help others, and it will help this company as well.
nm-268	I’m ready, I’m ready!
nm-269	I’m hella excited!
nm-269	I might be picking up a new sponsor!
nm-270	I will be posting more here once I get… comfortable again.
nm-270	(Self-love is important!)
nm-270	I’m on and off though, and have quite a bit of messages to go through - will get to them when I can :-)
nm-270	In the meantime, Happy New Year!
nm-270	P.S. I don’t have a Snapchat and don’t take any money, I just like to show off, you know, closet slut things :-) lol
nm-270	Talk to you later, everyone!
nm-271	He said “shh, just kiss me you fool”.
nm-271	I still love him and I cried so much on Valentine’s weekend (don’t judge, lmao), but I said “No. You’re fucked up now.
nm-271	What’s going on?”
nm-271	He never replied to me afterwards, and this interaction took about 10 minutes through text.
nm-271	Today he says “good lord, what the fuck happened?
nm-271	I’ve got to garden.
nm-271	Talk to you later”.
nm-271	He read my reply, which said “I’m so worried about you!
nm-271	Why would you take that?
nm-271	Where did you find it, and why would you take it?
nm-271	Eat and stay hydrated”.
nm-271	I just don’t know anymore.
nm-271	I suspected it, but I want him to be upfront about it with me.
nm-271	I love him, and he will always be my first, and I’ll always talk to him and care for him, but I don’t want to be held in limbo.
nm-271	I’m trying to move on and this is now in my head.
nm-272	I know whenever I say “talk to you later” or “good night” or whatever I want to add an “I love you”. Just casually. To see what happens.
nm-272	I know that every time I get a text from them I get super excited.
nm-272	I know when I am having a bad day, just thinking of them makes me feel so much better.
nm-272	Just knowing I can go home and text them brightens my mood ten-fold.
nm-272	I know sometimes I daydream about just holding them and being near them.
nm-272	But what I don’t know is what this means.
nm-272	I’ve known them nearly four months now.
nm-272	That’s not long.
nm-272	It makes me feel like this is an infatuation that will pass.
nm-272	To be honest, I kind of hope it is, because I don’t think it’s mutual.
nm-272	But oof, is it hitting me hard!
nm-272	Is it merely infatuation?
nm-273	Their explanation is that they’re a bad texter, or busy, but honestly so am I (I will takes days or a week to respond), but I don’t leave people on read or open messages I know I can’t respond to at the moment.
nm-273	It really isn’t that hard to send a quick “talk to you later” either to be honest.
nm-273	Finally they seem to want to engage with me and basically tell me they’re going to an event and they’d hope to see me there, which they reaffirm the next day and then on the day.
nm-273	I go to event, they never show.
nm-273	At this point I’m too stressed from a lot of other shit I got going on, and it’s not like we’re really talking, so I just block them.
nm-274	I don’t know, I need to change my mindset or this and that for my benefit and survival.
nm-274	I’m still “Ocean Serene”, but maybe I’m... I don’t know, that’s a tough thing to say, I never thought that my girlfriend was just a random.
nm-274	I love her to death, she is my boo and will always be it.
nm-274	Just like I said a lot of things, I’m gonna agree that if I change, the world changes.
nm-274	The advice you get, it’s always iffy.
nm-274	I want to speak for everyone, but at the same time I can only speak for myself.
nm-274	Also, I went to get some rum and coke.
nm-274	I got coke and a few other people saw it, so they bought some coke… erm, I hope my friends are ok (that’s all you weirdos I’m talking about).
nm-274	Random story I know.
nm-274	To be honest, I’m not ok, but I’m surviving like usual.
nm-274	Actually I’m all just a bit right and fine. Talk to you later.
nm-274	Talk to you later.
nm-275	[bro] Across the country?
nm-275	She acts like 500 miles is a long way.
nm-275	[me] lol, it’s 8 hours to [redacted], 7 to [redacted].
nm-275	Not a big deal.
nm-275	[bro] I suppose when you don’t maintain your vehicles, an hour’s drive could be detrimental.
nm-275	[me] lol
nm-275	[me] I suppose [redacted] or [redacted]’s wife ratted me out.
nm-275	Maybe I should block them too.
nm-275	[bro] Sorry for her awkward messages.
nm-275	I was in the middle of a drunk nap when she pulled up to my house, and I told her you jumped ship.
nm-275	Told her not to try to contact you, and we can see how well that went.
nm-275	[me] Shit. Betrayal.
nm-275	[bro] I’m sure she’s contacting you for her own self-gratification.
nm-276	I was in a toxic relationship for 4 months.
nm-276	During our dating period and a month or so into our relationship, we were great.
nm-276	One day, both of us were jealous of each other for no reason.
nm-276	I’m going to admit that sometimes when I feel jealous, I just want her to reassure me like how I reassure her that it’s all good, but she will only reassure me once and then said “bye” or “talk to you later”.
nm-276	Most of the time in an argument, it’s always my fault.
nm-276	She won’t admit to anything or say sorry.
nm-276	I will always be the one to give in so that the fight won’t continue anymore.
nm-277	And I said “But yeah yeah, you’re right.”
nm-277	And he said “Yeah, well I’ve got to go. I’m doing something”, and I was going to type “alright, talk to you later”, but I realized we aren’t at that level anymore.
nm-277	I didn’t like that.
nm-277	The vibe was going good.
nm-277	I didn’t have a bad vibe. When the conversation started.
nm-277	But once he said he’s doing something, my heart dropped.
nm-277	Like, what was he doing?
nm-277	He’s never done this before.
nm-277	This was such a different person.
nm-277	I hate it.
nm-277	What can I do?
nm-277	All these attempts I made were basically shut down.
nm-277	I like him, but I’m not trying to flirt or do anything!
nm-277	I know he doens’t like me like that.
nm-277	We talked about it.
nm-277	Right now, I’m just chatting with him.
nm-277	But he doesn’t seem like he wants to do that.
nm-277	If he doesn’t want to talk to me, he can just fucking tell me.
nm-278	I don’t know what else to put besides that I hate the current circumstance of  life I live in.
nm-278	I’m going to give a little insight tomorrow.
nm-278	Ok, I lied.
nm-278	I have to reveal my age tomorrow, because if I don’t, it’ll mess up the story.
nm-278	Um, I don’t know what to type so I’ll type a worry I have.
nm-278	Um, I don’t think I’ll get the tape gun in time.
nm-278	Ok bye, talk to you later everyone.
nm-279	She said something like “but I want to make sure that we go as a friend?” thing and I was like “okay, I know”, and sometimes she talks about her relationship and she said “of course I like my long time boyfriend”.
nm-279	Yeah, whatever, right, haha.
nm-279	And here’s my question...
nm-279	Yesterday when I was at work, she messaged me saying something like “how’s your work doing?”, and I kind of replied to her with a cold tone saying “I’m at work, talk to you later”, and then she, kind of upset: “Okay, I mean I understand you are at work so busy, but you didn’t cut me off like this before; so I kind of get it that you don’t want to talk anymore like before.
nm-279	Got it!
nm-279	Bye!”
nm-280	And my machine fucking freezes up.
nm-280	It’s been happening for like 2 days now...
nm-280	This machine can run a goddamn $26,000 3D scanner, but 4 browser tabs on Reddit and new a chat session uses up 87% of my damn memory and 60% of my CPU power and freezes the whole damn thing up.
nm-281	Hey! Wait!
nm-281	I’ve got a new complaint! Seriously, what the fuck are you developers doing?
nm-281	Stop, please!
nm-282	If you think it’s rude to just walk away in the middle of a conversation without excusing yourself, or at least saying “got to go, I’ll talk to you later”, then it’s also rude when texting.
nm-282	I could let it go if it was a one-off.
nm-282	Things happen.
nm-282	Maybe something came up and you got distracted, etc.
nm-282	But every single person ghosts in the middle of a conversation.
nm-282	It’s really not that hard to just say “got to go, I’ll text you later” or “so-and-so just got home, talk to you later”.
nm-282	Even just “bye” or “be right back” or something!
nm-283	Today I got mad and just flat out asked him to tell me where the problem was and if I did something wrong.
nm-283	He said he was with his friends and he didn’t want to ignore them just to talk to me.
nm-283	I said it wouldn’t be a problem if he had just said something like “I can’t talk right now” or “I’m with my friends, talk to you later” or just literally anything.
nm-283	He then said I was overthinking stuff and I should “chill out”, so I left it at that.
nm-283	So am I the asshole and overthinking things?
nm-284	Am I the asshole for getting mad at my boyfriend after he ignored me for a few days?
nm-285	So I would usually post this on r/keto, but that subreddit is so intense about their keto.
nm-285	And I respect it.
nm-285	But, like, a girl’s got to rant.
nm-285	I started keto a few weeks ago.
nm-285	I have been doing well, and I feel like I’ve lost weight.
nm-285	Out of nowhere, I get slammed with cravings.
nm-285	My body is like “bitch, calories please”.
nm-285	I oh so badly want to make it to my goal weight and flock around on a beach in a bathing suit, and I also want to honor the tenacity that r/keto so proudly espouses in their “no cheat days” mantra.
nm-285	But, alas, another side of me wants to curl up in my bed with my favorite gluten-free dairy-free carbohydrate dense carrot cake and go to satiety land.
nm-286	As far I as I know, the concept of mini-album is only around in K-pop (maybe I-pop?).
nm-286	I’m always disappointed when a long-awaited comeback or something is only some 4 or 5-song album.
nm-286	I can tolerate a debut album, since you really don’t have a lot of material, but if you’re SNSD or something and you come out with mini after a years long hiatus like Mr.Mr, it’s kind of insulting.
nm-287	I don’t know what to say, lol.
nm-287	I’m pretty funny, not only because I manage to trip over air and choke on my own saliva far too often, but also because I’m just fucking hilarious to be honest.
nm-287	I’m from Yorkshire, and that probably makes me cooler than you, because the North is just superior, and I’m ready to die on this hill, but I guess we can be mates.
nm-287	I would really like some of those.
nm-287	Ok, I’m running out of people to laugh at my jokes.
nm-288	17M from the UK,
nm-288	Please be able to hold a conversation, lol.
nm-289	I don’t know what kind of dog this was, but it was so ugly.
nm-289	My god, who would own such a thing?
nm-289	Dogs with wrinkles like Pugs, Shar Peis (I don’t know how to spell it), Bulldogs, Boxers, any dog with those ugly ass wrinkles are so dumb.
nm-289	I’m not a dog hater at all; I love dogs.
nm-289	But the breeds that I mentioned are so fucking ugly and gross they shouldn’t be owned, and I’ve literally been told these kinds of dogs need surgery just to live a proper life.
nm-289	(Wrinkles over eyes cause blindness and over the nose, they can’t breathe)
nm-289	And yes, I know I’m going to get shit on by all the fucking neckbeards on Reddit that just adore their snot nose little Pug.
nm-289	I don’t even care.
nm-289	I’m so tired of people and their dogs.
nm-290	Are boobs nice? Because, I don’t know, I’ve never seen them before.
nm-291	Then he checks the oil level, saying that the oil also smells like gasoline, that gasoline and oil are mixing up together.
nm-291	He opens one spark plug, sees the massive leak in there literally full up.
nm-291	Let me say, oil smells like gasoline.
nm-291	I didn’t smell that one.
nm-291	That’s what the worker told me.
nm-291	Then he call his boss, and the boss says it is not gasoline, it is just oil, “that shit smells like gasoline” 🤦🏾‍♂️
nm-291	Even the worker confirmed that I’m not crazy, but ay, maybe I am.
nm-291	And his worker told me he was going to seal the black thing that goes on top of the spark plug that covers it.
nm-291	Sorry, my English is not that amazing.
nm-291	He said he was putting a seal after draining the oil as he mentioned.
nm-291	As oil drained, the oil sealed the thing so oil doesn’t drip out of it and doesn’t drip to the floor.
nm-291	But it didn’t help me find the cause of why oil is getting into the spark plug, because a seal on the coil plug ignition 🤦🏾‍♂️
nm-291	He tells me if the problem keeps on, it is maybe my oil catch can that is sending way too much oil and is causing the oil leak, that if the problems persist I will have to remove it.
nm-291	Sorry for the long paragraph, but I need advice.
nm-291	I need help to be honest.
nm-292	My rabbit didn’t eat or drink, so I went to check him.
nm-292	It’s been now 4 or 5 hours and I saw him now drink and eat a little bit.
nm-292	I have to give him medicines and the thing which is like food, I don’t know.
nm-292	(He has constipation so I’m going to check if he poops.)
nm-292	How do I sleep if I have to check on my rabbit?
nm-292	My sleep schedule is going to become chaotic, lol.
nm-293	I assume the time has already passed for this, but, I don’t know, I figured I may as well ask.
nm-293	I kind of forgot I even had those tickets until they announced they’d be touring again today.
nm-294	Now, my aunts (grandma’s sisters) are telling me I should not give her half of the money due to the way she treated grandma both before and after she passed.
nm-294	When my grandma first started getting sick, my sister wasn’t the best, because she had just got a new boyfriend.
nm-294	She didn’t reach out a lot to my grandma, and didn’t go to see her.
nm-294	I would go out as much as possible, but grandma was also scared of Covid.
nm-294	The month before she passed, I told my job I couldn’t come in and would drive the hour to her house and stay with her (back and forth sometimes).
nm-294	I had finals going on at the same time, and had to figure out a place to live.
nm-295	Would I be the asshole if I didn’t give my sister half of our inheritance?
nm-296	So I met this girl like 2 weeks ago and we are dating.
nm-296	Last night, everything was all right, she was happy said “good night” and “I love you” like every night.
nm-296	And the next morning when I texted her good morning, she left me on seen and blocked me.
nm-296	One of her friend said that she was sad as fuck all day because of me but didn’t want to say why.
nm-296	I don’t know what I did.
nm-296	I did nothing.
nm-296	What should I do?
nm-296	How can I contact her?
nm-296	Should I give her space?
nm-297	My girlfriend blocked me, and I don’t know why.
nm-298	Mine’s ending and all my grades are passable except for biology in which I have an F.
nm-298	This is because I made the mistake of turning things into her desk and not the bin, meaning I have like 4 or 5 assignments that I’ve done but are nowhere in the books,
nm-298	This kind of snuck up on me, because I thought they were done and filed, only to check my grades and find out they weren’t.
nm-298	Anybody else have this problem?
nm-298	(if you are going to say “I know right, I only have an 89, why couldn’t she round up? Fuck my life)
nm-298	I’m going to be honest, that’s not very helpful right now.
nm-299	So first off, Bard top.
nm-299	What a pick, I know right?
nm-299	Let’s drop down my main build, because it’s the best assassin play style I like.
nm-299	*my core is static/ie/RFC.
nm-299	Now, I tried many ways, and this is the best way.
nm-299	I like to safely clear and lay out poke.
nm-299	Now under certain occasions like against a Garen, I’d go what many would call Shotgun Bard, swapping out static for Runaan’s and if needed rapid firecannon for Phantom Dancer.
nm-299	Giving some more tank…
nm-299	Now, as for the other two, I actually leave them more optional picks in the ability power department or in which case magic pen.
nm-299	In this section is a few situations for more sustain.
nm-299	I’d pick up Hextech Gunblade.
nm-299	This item is phenomenal on Bard, and hits are great.
nm-299	If you’re already carrying hard, I’d go something like Liandry’s, because with the lead, no one will catch you with this, and the chunk is just Bard crazy.
nm-299	I’m tet to try Gunblade and Liandry’s together, but someday…
nm-300	Hey guys, Bard main.
nm-300	I just joined Reddit after finding out there are other off-meta Bards!
nm-300	So I main him top.
nm-300	Yes, it’s scary, but I do.
nm-300	So I’ve been getting a lot of questions about my builds from friends and happy on-lookers lately!
nm-300	I thought I’d share my builds!
nm-301	I’m 16 years old, 5’9.
nm-301	I’m new to basketball and I’d like to ask for drills I can do by myself so I can be good or even great at it.
nm-301	I only have one basketball and half a court.
nm-301	I don’t have a decent shot nor a decent handle,
nm-301	I could barely reach the backboard plus I have no friends so don’t even ask how good my defense is.
nm-301	The reason why I wanted to be good at it so bad is because I just want people to know me as somebody, because right now I’m a nobody,
nm-301	I want to be somebody.
nm-301	P.S. I’ve never played an actual basketball ever in my life… I know, right?
nm-302	Hi guys, I’ve always had a lot of trouble making friends and consider myself kind of standoffish and awkward at times (that cancer rising, you know) but pretty chill once you get past that.
nm-302	Super loyal and empathetic, pretty smart (when I want to be), goofy, a little chaotic, big overthinker kind of deal.
nm-302	Enneagram type 4, because apparently that matters (just kidding!).
nm-302	I’m honestly really looking for some truly kind, genuine people that might share some of my goals of breaking patterns and cycles, trying to be better, treating others with respect, dignity, and love... you get the gist :-)
nm-303	I dream of becoming a psychiatrist, so a program with medical school prerequisites would be preferable.
nm-303	Plus, I plan to take my medical school abroad (wow, big dreams much?
nm-303	I doubt I’d get in, but it wouldn’t hurt to try though).
nm-303	Academics aside, the community is also important to me.
nm-303	I’d be even more motivated to study if my teachers are kind and if my classmates are easy to get along with.
nm-303	Oh, and location too.
nm-303	I’m short, so if my classes are far, I might as well rollerskate my way through campus, just kidding.
nm-304	You set up a dramatic encounter, a dramatic fight, and then Ellie gets the upper hand.
nm-304	Then, you give the player an option.
nm-304	Do you kill Abby, or spare her?
nm-304	That way, players can decide if they want to kill someone who now seems human, and someone they feel bad for, or shoot her ass and laugh as she dies, glad you avenged your former character.
nm-304	Or, you know... Have Ellie kill Abby.
nm-304	Seriously, doing this would’ve prevented so much backlash.
nm-304	Easy, simple, you do the thing that the player was expected to do.
nm-304	The player goes home somewhat fulfilled.
nm-305	An opinion from someone who hasn’t played TLOU 1 or 2.
nm-306	So basically, I kind of have a crush right now, but I don’t know if I want to pursue her.
nm-306	It’s complicated.
nm-306	Right now its summer break, so I’m going to wait until school starts again to try for real again.
nm-306	I can actually talk to girls in person, because they don’t talk to me online, lol.
nm-306	I don’t know how long this series will go, but I will try to post every day until it happens.
nm-306	As of right now my confidence in finding a girlfriend is very low.
nm-306	I don’t know how long this is going to take but probably quite a while.
nm-306	All I want is for someone to love me for me and a girl that I can share my feelings with, since right now I don’t have a person to do that with.
nm-307	I would like to take this moment to say that if you’re a kid, like an elementary school kid and you’re here, where the fuck are your parents?
nm-307	lol, never mind, fuck them.
nm-307	You are so much better than them.
nm-308	Because I got them and no one to give them too, lmao, just kidding,  unless...
nm-309	Anyone order 3 large fries, 1 medium Sprite and a McDouble?
nm-310	Hey, hi!
nm-310	Haha... I’m new here, I didn’t know this existed until now.
nm-310	I am extremely shy and don’t know what I’m doing here typing this, haha.
nm-310	But hey, first time for everything right?
nm-310	If we don’t click and you lose interest, then please tell me, no ghosting please.
nm-310	I will cry, lmao.
nm-310	I don’t expect to get any messages, but hey, it’s worth a try.
nm-310	P.S. I don’t know how to write these properly, so I tried to copy this one post I saw that was in a bullet format, oh my.
nm-310	Oh and if I don’t reply soon, it might mean I’m asleep or playing DnD, hehe.
nm-311	Never mind.
nm-311	My internet is down right now.
nm-311	Fuck.
nm-312	Well I’m going to see if I can buy some stuff off Steam now...
nm-312	Let’s hope there are still some good sales.
nm-313	Okay, so I was a total noob and erased my seeds since I made a new wallet that I was going to use, but I sent Monero to that wallet instead of my new one.
nm-313	I know the password but not the seeds.
nm-313	Is it possible to retrieve your wallet?
nm-313	Or how do you open the .key file?
nm-313	Edit: never mind, I’m a complete noob.
nm-313	I figured it out.
nm-314	Possible to retrive Monero wallet seeds with a .keyfile?
nm-315	user765123: No, I just had the “is now playing” thing show up.
nm-315	A: I know.
nm-315	A: Well, here we go.
nm-315	A: “easily disturbed”, lol
nm-315	A: Momma, help me.
nm-315	A: Help me.
nm-315	A: What’s the canon name?
nm-315	user765123: ?
nm-315	A: my name.
nm-315	A: What’s the canon one?
nm-315	user765123: There is none, pick whatever name you want.
nm-315	A: Oh.
nm-315	A: Am I a girl?
nm-315	user765123: Male.
nm-315	A: Argh.
nm-315	<talking about their name here>
nm-315	user765123: That seems like a good name.
nm-315	user765123: lol
nm-315	A: >:-)
nm-315	user765123: (not that it really matters. I just used my real life name)
nm-316	Comment
nm-316	So I can guess your gender based on your post history.
nm-317	Never mind… let me guess your gender instead.
nm-318	So the deadline to drop a full year course with permission from the professor is October 18.
nm-318	(Edit: never mind, this part isn’t true, please disregard).
nm-318	The deadline to drop without receiving a grade is February 9.
nm-318	Does this mean I still have to inform the professor that I’m dropping the course?
nm-318	Do I also have to get permission?
nm-318	I’m planning to take 2 other courses so I still take the same amount of credits by the way.
nm-319	I just didn’t have the confidence to speak and tell jokes and stuff.
nm-319	I was actually sweating at the presence of these other people.
nm-319	I was avoiding eye contact and trying to face as far away from them as possible.
nm-319	When I really wanted to speak to my friends, I’d quietly mumble a joke to them.
nm-319	But one time, he didn’t hear it and so he was like “what?!” really loudly.
nm-319	I felt my heart rate increase and started sweating more.
nm-319	I would just say “never mind”, because I felt like I was in the motherfucking spotlight.
nm-320	To be honest, has anyone ever experienced fighting a 2v1 or maybe a 3v1 against a tank that doesn’t die and manage to kill a least one of you?
nm-320	Talking to that rampage and crunch, but rampage didn’t pop his ult yet.
nm-320	😲 What the fuck?!
nm-320	Now, again, what would paragon be without the current pressure hunter right now?
nm-320	My guess is a team with growth totem with 2 tanks, a stun-or-not caster, a tanky as fuck fighter, and a carry that solos everything if he wants to.
nm-321	When I turn off those 2 switches, it drops down to between .28- 2.1
nm-321	When they are gone for 2 or 3 days at a time and we leave switches on, it stays down also.
nm-321	I’m not positive, but I think the owners are aware and did it to cut corners.
nm-321	However, there’s always the possibility that the man behind us did it.
nm-321	So I’ve had enough.
nm-321	I finally decided I’m done paying $300 electric bills so it can be 48 degrees in my house with no hot water.
nm-321	So I know I’m really opening up a can of worms with my landlord, but it’s not legal and I shouldn’t have to pay someone else’s expenses, never mind the $6000+ that was destroyed simply by being plugged in...
nm-321	Oh, and the part where I barely sleep at night at fear of burning down, and I won’t leave my dog home alone either in fear a fire will catch while I’m not home.
nm-322	Like now I feel guilty for smiling.
nm-322	Never mind the fake ones shit, but fuck.
nm-322	Haha. Ugh.
nm-322	Why am I still alive?
nm-323	lol, why the fuck does smiling hurt?
nm-324	Then I see a figure slowly walking towards my general direction, and I finally look up.
nm-324	The moment I look up, Paul is looking straight at me, still walking towards me.
nm-324	I don’t say anything or look back down, because, get this: he says the first he’s ever said to me in the sexiest, most hottest, attractive way possible.
nm-324	He says “What’s up?” in this low, quieter voice but has the cutest but at the same time hottest smile ever.
nm-324	I blow up inside and I smile back, not holding back my overjoyed emotions.
nm-324	And I say “hi”, with the biggest smile I probably had.
nm-324	I’m just praying to God now that I didn’t have nasty stuff in my teeth or that my face didn’t look disgusting.
nm-324	But I look straight nail down at my food and pokerfacedely keep eating my food.
nm-324	I do that for maybe 3 seconds.
nm-324	Then I look back up.
nm-324	Paul has just stated walking away, which means he was standing there looking at me or doing God knows what for 3 seconds.
nm-325	Edit: Yes, I know.
nm-325	Plants are important.
nm-325	Oxygen. Useful, I know.
nm-325	But ugh. They really could focus on something more entertaining like how poisons and toxins affect our body.
nm-325	By the way, there some great documentaries about it T_T
nm-325	Edit 2: never mind. I’ll just print the thing
nm-326	I was playing normal, just got into an alliance. Oops, now I’m not getting any MP!
nm-326	Try to type in chat, “I will not cheat on this game!”
nm-326	The message repeats every time I hit enter.
nm-326	What the fuck!
nm-326	I’m not cheating.
nm-326	Anyway, I type those words into the chat (“I will not cheat on this game!”) and it tells me to pay the server and turn off Adblock.
nm-326	Worst way to tell a player to turn off Adblock, but whatever.
nm-326	It tells me to turn off then refresh.
nm-326	I do and lost my best game and restart as a new player.
nm-326	10/10 I’m never playing again.
nm-326	Edit: never mind, anytime I type in the chat, the same shit happens.
nm-327	I’m going to skip the Oscar-bait shit like The Post, because there’s only some much concentrated rage at milquetoast Democrats making movies about how (extremely wonky nasal nerd voice) “politics used to be more polite. We need a return to the discourse.”
nm-327	I’m sure I forgot a couple.
nm-328	Will he be so much better that he’s worth more than Kinlaw and the player(s) that we pick from the extra picks we get?
nm-328	OT could be there like Thomas, but I’m just not convinced any guy we take will be better than Little entering his 2nd year.
nm-328	He has health concerns at the moment, but we also have Daley entering his 2nd year and is a decent safety net.
nm-328	Interior offensive line I think is a major problem, but there is no Nelson-like prospects that are going in the top 10.
nm-328	Edge might be a need depending on FA, and the Iowa guy (I cannot spell his name) is good, but that’s still a bit of a reach.
nm-328	If we do not resign Bradberry and Okudah is there, that’s really the only situation where I absolutely stay put.
nm-329	2 months ago, I bought a cheap ’95 Nissan truck.
nm-329	I was only locally driving, so it took the better part of a week to realize I couldn’t put it to 60mph, or that I had to floor it to hit 3500 rpm.
nm-329	(although it has a little transmission-slippage from 1st to 2nd only when dead-cold, this problem is the engine for sure as I can’t rev it past 3k in my driveway without feeling like I’m going to break something,
nm-329	I can only get the 3500 rpm when driving and flooring it.
nm-329	It’ll hit close to 3500 right before gear-shifts)
nm-329	I was trying to methodically rule out what could be causing this power-sap, i.e. is it the air or fuel or a clogged cat or exhaust, etc. or something entirely different?
nm-329	I ruled out “different”, I think, by seeing that it will roll down-hill just fine in neutral, so no mechanical interferences.
nm-330	Hey! I read somewhere that it can ruin his puppy teeth and small parts can be dangerous.
nm-330	Is it safe to give him a bone?
nm-330	They are pretty big, almost his size.
nm-331	Can I give my 2-month Boston Terrier puppy raw beef bones?
nm-332	[HELP] My puppy has suddenly refused to poop anywhere except inside.
nm-333	My friends think she said that because she was with her new man and she needed me to not blow her phone up, etc.
nm-333	Others think it’s a way for her to be evil, like think of me, because I’m never coming to get that charm.
nm-333	I think it’s some type of hoover, good or bad.
nm-333	Any insight is appreciated.
nm-333	If you’re a woman, please tell me your perspective.
nm-333	So confused, but she is clearly with someone else, and why couldn’t she call me back and why didn’t she respond to my text messages?
nm-333	She could’ve said “I’m with my boyfriend, please don’t call me”, but she didn’t.
nm-334	Just a side note: my boyfriend and I are buying a house.
nm-334	We will be moving out in 2 months.
nm-334	Once the papers are all finalized.
nm-334	I have an Australian Shepherd, 9 months.
nm-334	My boyfriend (24M) and I (25F) got her at 3 months.
nm-334	We take her on play dates every other week.
nm-334	She has a pair of dogs she likes to play tag with, a black Labrador and a small dog that is a mix of something.
nm-334	We take her to see a Rat Terrier.
nm-334	Their play style is boxing.
nm-334	And one of my room mates (25M) has a Beagle.
nm-334	He doesn’t like to play much.
nm-334	In fact, he seems kind of scared too.
nm-335	I know all of these things about my dog.
nm-335	I know that it doesn’t matter if your dog is friendly, aggressive, or otherwise, doesn’t matter if your dog is already barking and growling, or just minding its own business.
nm-335	What matters is that my dog is nervous.
nm-335	So when I hold my hand out and tell you, “no, he’s not sitting or lying down because he’s calmly waiting for you to say hi, it’s because he’s nervous and insecure”,  I don’t mean it as a joke, and it’s not an invitation for you to say, “aw, well my dog/child is very friendly, so let me approach!”
nm-335	I don’t care if your dog/child is friendly or “dog savvy”.
nm-335	I don’t care if your dog “is just a puppy”.
nm-335	(why the hell is that even relevant?
nm-335	Is my dog not allowed to be nervous around other puppies?).
nm-335	I don’t care if your child is capable of not screeching “oh my God, a puppy”.
nm-336	Can you, you know, do something about your child? And also your dog?
nm-337	But with less than 3 months to go for that, I feel I’m not ready yet, but having never taken it, I have nothing to compare it to besides colleagues’ advice.
nm-337	Without knowing what I know, they can’t know if I’m actually ready yet, but many of them are pushing me to sign up for it.
nm-337	I want this bad and it would be awesome to be done 6 months from my introductory exam.
nm-337	I’m close... I just don’t know if I’m 2 months study close.
nm-338	Some certified advice.
nm-339	(M/5’10”/26/165-195lbs) 2 months progress, am I gaining too much weight?
nm-340	I know this sounds weird, but here’s my issue.
nm-340	About 4 months ago, I had an 3700X which died after start, crashing when I tried to play games, and a day later not booting.
nm-340	I sent to RMA, they confirmed the CPU was dead and gave my money back after 2 months.
nm-340	After that I got an 3800X.
nm-340	As soon as I tried, I got the boot code 7b, everything powered up but no reboots or video signal.
nm-340	I sent to RMA this time with the store.
nm-340	After 1 month they confirmed the CPU was faulty and sent me a new one.
nm-340	I got the new one yesterday, same issue.
nm-341	My mom (T) has always been the type where her feelings matter first and only.
nm-341	If something she does is wrong, she manipulates it into being someone else’s fault entirely.
nm-341	For example: I needed someone to babysit our then 2-month-old for 3-4 hours.
nm-341	Dad’s work had someone who had Covid.
nm-341	We opted out of them watching our son and asked my sister.
nm-341	I approached this topic as usual with T by trying to talk to her before I set it all up, because I knew it would upset her.
nm-341	T got her hopes up, then its my fault and she tried getting me to apologize for getting her hopes up.
nm-341	I talked to her days after the incident, because she didn’t call me after hanging up on me, told her how I felt about the whole thing,
nm-341	T promptly got off the phone.
nm-341	I never got an apology.
nm-341	B still thinks I am owed an apology, other things have happened since then due to T’s narcissism.
nm-341	I don’t expect an apology from T, because she never has once ever apologized for anything she’s ever done wrong.
nm-342	Would I be the asshole for keeping our house in the divorce so I can rent out the other rooms?
nm-343	My EBF son is 5.5 months, 75th percentile weight and ahead in most milestones.
nm-343	Since 2 months, he’s co-slept with us because of frequent night wakings.
nm-343	We have all the bad habits - including nurse to sleep and nurse to nap, yes, the entire nap.
nm-343	I’ve been sleeping 1-2 hour intervals for what feels like forever.
nm-344	TLDR: tips/support to get a 2-month baby sleeping beyond one sleep cycle in bassinet (currently replacing pacifier every hour).
nm-344	First time mother to a sweet 2-month-old girl, and I’m finding any progress we’ve made with sleeping is gone.
nm-345	First time mother struggling with sleeps.
nm-346	So I already have an orange golden chinchilla (Toto, 2 months old) and we have had Toto for 3 weeks now and felt she needed company, so we got Terri (2-month Himalayan Ragdoll) to keep each other company.
nm-346	It’s only been a few hours and she feels very sleepy, but when we pet her she sounds like a running car motor.
nm-346	Just always going “brr rrr rrr”.
nm-346	I’m not sure if she has a blocked nose, because Toto never made this kind of sound...
nm-346	Am I just being paranoid?
nm-347	Cat is making a purr noise or something similar?
nm-348	I can’t play until tomorrow but would like to know, so I can make money hunting or robbing everything and everyone.
nm-349	How much do pelts sell for online?
nm-350	Usually I’m quietly confident going into these games but with injuries, players missing etc., I’m kind of happy if we get a draw.
nm-350	I know they’re utter piss and paper-wise, we should be wiping the floor with them, but I’m just not feeling the 2/3-nil vibe at the moment!
nm-350	Anyone want to talk me round and make me feel happy and warm and confident again?
nm-351	This is the story all about how my life got flip turned upside down-wait never mind, shit meme.
nm-351	I was 6 and playing Lego Rock Band,
nm-351	I decided to ask for the Buddy Holly pack.
nm-351	My parents (despite being in their 40’s) said “how the shit do you know that?”
nm-351	I never realised that my parents got into Weezer.
nm-351	So that’s how I got into Weezer.
nm-352	I genuinely don’t understand how “toxic” behavior is more punished than literally int or troll.
nm-352	Well, I’ve had an account which always received those rewards for being friendly or sportsmanlike until I got in a bad streak of losses in ranked, and in a longer run my account got chat restricted.
nm-352	Then I read some of the things that had been marked as toxic behavior.... And most of it were arguments.
nm-352	The bot that searches your in-game chat for toxic behavior after a report doesn’t understand the context.
nm-353	I asked him if I should eat cereal or just wait until the morning, but then I said “never mind, I just realized it’s almost 2.
nm-353	I’ll just wait”.
nm-353	And then he asked what would happen if I ate it right now and I said nothing.
nm-353	It’s just too late.
nm-353	Now he’s telling me to just say “fuck it” and just eat the cereal.
nm-353	So inspiring, but I just put my rubber bands in so it’s too officially late :-(
nm-354	Before I realized it was 2.
nm-355	Help, lol, oh wait, I can just Google it.
nm-355	Never mind, lol
nm-356	How to delete a subreddit.
nm-357	I know your skin isn’t perfect or you’re insecure about your nose or looks.
nm-357	But those flaws are what makes you different.
nm-357	It gives you an identity amidst all of these people that live a fake perfect life.
nm-357	You’re beautiful, because you’re you.
nm-357	Rant over.
nm-357	Actually, never mind.
nm-357	God, why did you give me this huge ass nose?
nm-357	I’m too ugly to even rant on Snapchat, so I do it on Reddit instead.
nm-357	Ok, it’s over now. Hopefully.
nm-358	Can I get an RIP in the chat boys?
nm-358	I was trying to go to sleep, because I couldn’t, when I got two notifications from this girl I really liked, but I didn’t look at my phone and I went back to sleep.
nm-358	Fucking kill me.
nm-358	I’ll keep you updated on what she says, because she only said my name in all caps and then a “never mind”.
nm-358	Fuck.
nm-359	I just realized I’m complaining over a 5-minute fix…
nm-360	I don’t like him or anything, but I had some dreams about him where I cheated on my boyfriend with him.
nm-360	I wouldn’t do that to him of course, but I was just wondering how bad is it to cheat?
nm-361	Me: I’m highkey liking boys more right now.
nm-361	lol, this is no culture.
nm-362	I’m still trying to fucking finish this project while studying for a final on Wednesday.
nm-362	And it’s my actual birthday tomorrow, lol.
nm-363	This is not meant as a rant.
nm-363	It’s only just informing Oro mains that they look noobs whenever they play Oro.
nm-363	Never mind, I guess this is a rant.
nm-364	Never mind, it’s back up.
nm-365	That’s like ordering food at a restaurant and then saying “ah, never mind, I want to eat somewhere else” as soon as they’re bringing the food out.
nm-366	I played a game as Rengar and I was 6/2 and got solo killed by Anvia who didn’t have Rod of Ages or Tear finished yet.
nm-366	I looked over at the replay 100 times and all I can think to my self is, if we both played the 1v1 perfectly which we both did, the Anivia will win CNA.
nm-366	Someone please explain why the fuck an Anivia is strong than a Rengar in a 1v1 when the Rengar has a gold lead?
nm-366	Actually, never mind. I don’t care.
nm-366	I’m just quitting this brain dead game.
nm-367	I hit her fender in a parking lot, we checked the damage and both agreed to just let it be.
nm-367	But after I drove off, she follows me for about 30 seconds and says “never mind”, so I just gave her mine and went on with my day.
nm-368	I’m so sick of hearing the same beats of Mexican music, ahh!
nm-368	Edit: I lied: the party started at 8 am and the music stopped just now at 7:30 pm.
nm-368	God, if I have to go through this every weekend, I’ll just kill myself.
nm-368	Edit 2: lol, 10 minutes later, never mind, the music started again.
nm-368	What the fuck!
nm-368	Edit 3: It started raining, so the party ended haha!
nm-369	People go in the dark alone.
nm-369	No one could be that stupid!
nm-369	If there’s a ghost in the house, why the hell would you go in the darkest and creepiest place in the house?!
nm-369	Then they turn the flashlight a little too far and see the ghost.
nm-369	Then they know they’re screwed.
nm-369	4. The fuck are you splitting up for?!
nm-369	There’s always this one guy in horror movies that’s like: “Guys, there’s a crazy ass killer running around so we should totally split up and get ourselves killed”!
nm-369	That’s exactly what the killer wants!
nm-370	We get it, you’re mad the P90 is good.
nm-370	Just build, lol.
nm-370	All this Reddit has been is “true_warrior is a bad person, oh never mind, he’s good” and “P90 is broken. I’m quitting the game”.
nm-371	lol, never mind, I’m still here. I can’t sleep.
nm-372	lmao, it’s just me, never mind.
nm-373	Just what the title says.
nm-373	Do you pick up insects and spiders with your bare hands?
nm-373	I’m deathly afraid of insects and spiders, so I don’t know what to do.
nm-373	I want to kill them before they get away.
nm-374	Play a scuffed 24-hour WOW livestream filled with condescending undertones, belittling, and shitty half-assed ill-prepared gameplay. Throw begging, depression and sob stories on top of it and call it couples stream.
nm-375	An Altarian virus, anything is possible.
nm-375	In fact, that day on Onias Three, you were infected with the cell of its hosts ten days ago.
nm-375	You have been in a coma, delirious.
nm-375	Your fever broke this morning.
nm-376	I don’t have one, because I’m 17 and haven’t gotten around to it (and no, I’m not driving, because I’m terrified) and that I haven’t gotten my gender marker changed, so no updated documents at all.
nm-376	I have a passport from a while ago from before transitioning, so that doesn’t have an updated name either.
nm-376	So I have no idea what to do, because I’m going to an event with them on the 14th.
nm-376	If it helps, my dad’s a flight attendant (has been for like ever).
nm-376	Should I cancel?
nm-376	There is always next year, but, like, I’m lonely in real life, because my boyfriend is an hour away, and as much as I love my other real life buddies, I’d like a breath of fresh air :-(
nm-377	I don’t know if I will.
nm-377	If I do, I will be in my mid 30’s, because I want to live life my way.
nm-377	But I need to have sex to have kids and that isn’t going to happen (because honestly “me too”).
nm-378	I have to go camping for a scuba certification.
nm-378	There is a grill and they will eat burgers.
nm-378	But I am on a vegetarian diet.
nm-378	(I eat some animal products but much less than I did before.
nm-378	I eat 80% vegetarian)
nm-379	I got pretty close with an equalizer with a little low end and high end shaved off, going into a soft clipper.
nm-379	The equalizer before it makes it Slam.
nm-379	I was going to try distortion and a limiter after, when I get off work.
nm-379	(The limiter was highly suggested in the last post, so hopefully that’ll do the trick) I’m just looking for advice!
nm-380	You can easily get an infinite powerlock in longer fights.
nm-380	I have a 4/40 Dr Octopus, and I see some pretty good numbers on critical hits and SPS, so not bad in damage either (like vision).
nm-380	A very viable option for AW attack. and also arenas, as you don’t have to bait out in those small fights, because you never let them reach SP3 before you finish it.
nm-381	Get ready boys.
nm-382	Pogo will not open for me.
nm-382	It keeps saying this device is blah blah blah… you guys know what I’m talking about.
nm-382	Anyway, to fix this, I am on Android 6.0 before the security update and I have root with Magisk 16.0.
nm-383	Personally, I think VII was (alongside RB1) the best Neps games in the entire franchise, what with having a storyline that doesn’t come off as too edgy nor melodramatic like Mk2/RB2, but neither as over-the-top like V/RB3, having the exact and necessary amount of seriousness and comedy.
nm-383	The characters got much better developed, and everyone (specially Vert, Nepgear and the Twins) got their own time to shine and of course, it proves that the events don’t always have to rely on Neptune’s presence.
nm-384	Great bait, mate. I relate, straight appreciate, and congratulate.
nm-384	I rate this bait an 8/8.
nm-384	Please no hate,
nm-384	I’m straight irate.
nm-384	Create more,
nm-384	Can’t wait.
nm-384	We should conversate.
nm-384	I won’t berate.
nm-384	My number is 8888888,
nm-385	I’ve taken quite a few of these classes as a physics major for my electives... and I will take no more.
nm-385	They go up to the board and just starting writing math: Meh, ok, that’s fine.
nm-385	They then use shit like A subtract 1 through A subtract 20 for variables.
nm-385	In fact, I have a linear algebra book that did this... A’s for everything.
nm-385	The pages were just matrices filled with A’s.
nm-385	Just draw a weird shape or something - anything but that shit!
nm-386	Scariest thing ever mate.
nm-387	Well, well, here we are again, frustrated, angry in front of my phone.
nm-387	What a neat way to start isn’t it?
nm-387	All of you readers are my therapy and I don’t owe you a cent.
nm-387	Perfect, right?
nm-387	If you are like me you are probably not going to read it all because of your short attention span, so let’s keep it short (what a genius way to write after a long introduction saying “keep it short - I’m a genius aren’t I?”)
nm-387	Well I tried explaining to my buddies that porn is kind of shabby, and yeah just bad, and you know who listened…
nm-388	Hey, I just want to know what games I can run on this PC and which not.
nm-389	I was a spy, and on the first night I was jailed and I proudly told the jailor my role.
nm-389	I also got attacked whilst in jail.
nm-389	When day 2 had begun, Mafia and Serial Killer had made their kills.
nm-389	I proudly said: “I was attacked while in jail!”
nm-389	Wrong move.
nm-389	Jailor decides to jail me again and asks me “You were attacked while you were in jail?” and I answer “yes mate”.
nm-389	He then tells me that what I am saying is bullshit, because Serial Killer and Mafia have already made their kills.
nm-389	Then he executes me.
nm-389	Seriously?!
nm-390	Oh boy, you are too dumb for the movie, boy.
nm-390	The director was like “shit, it’s about the hidden meanings you have to find, boy, like you know it doesn’t spoon-feed you the film, you know?”
nm-390	Like shit, why does it have to explain, mate.
nm-390	Just imagine what happened, you know?
nm-390	It’s not like I pretend it has a deeper meaning than what it has, you know?
nm-391	Yet when fully charged for the first 30-60 minutes, it’s always on!
nm-391	Which is beautiful!
nm-391	Lastly, if I do not use the Smok Alien for an extended amount of time (say at night when sleeping), the battery reduces when left in the mod and the mod is turned off.
nm-391	What the fuck, mate?
nm-391	I just want to understand if all of this is the same for everyone, or is it just me?
nm-391	In searching Google, I cannot find an answer to any of these questions.
nm-391	Other than these issues, I am really enjoying the mod.
nm-391	It’s just a fucking ball ache every single time I want to vape to have to wait for the fucking thing to go through its motions before I can puff...
nm-392	Every time I log on, I want to chill away from keyword NMZ, and play Xbox and be fat, right, but lately I log on, play RS away from keyword for like 20 seconds and I get logged out, and it’s fucking annoying.
nm-392	Is it my internet connection or is it the servers or what?
nm-392	It’s pissing me off, mate.
nm-393	Next we have my statistics class, and I didn’t realize that we had additional homework to do online as well as the written homework; and so my grade was a 70 something, and then I bombed my final for it because of some family emergency that popped up involving my uncle and a car in a hit and run.
nm-393	So then my band class is basically easy A as it’s show up to a weekly practice and go to the one concert, and so I passed that. Good game, easy, mate.
nm-394	Dramatic death scenes and bringing the characters back with a gag do not go hand in hand.
nm-395	So I finally got to Blighttown, and was strolling about, minding my business, and a sniper started throwing darts at me.
nm-395	So I was like “what the fuck, mate?” and hid behind some destructible wood.
nm-395	After a certain time, he stopped attacking, so I showed myself and he reappeared, and started with the darts again.
nm-395	So a couple dozen darts after, I simply get +500 souls, and that purple moss stuff.
nm-395	So what the hell happened there.
nm-395	Did the motherfucker just kill himself in shame or what, he simply died all of the sudden?
nm-396	This year’s rookie game is actually going to be real exciting.
nm-396	What line-ups do you want to see?
nm-397	I love this show, but sadly I’m near to finishing it already.
nm-397	What is this called and are there other movies or shows based on this really special kind of story?
nm-397	I never watch movies or… so sorry about my lack of vocabulary on this though, is this called dystopian?
nm-397	Well I’m really lost, but I just want some other stuff like this to watch, it’s crazy!
nm-398	Has it happened to anyone else?
nm-398	It happened to me a number of times.
nm-399	So if you’re on leg 2, you have to win 10 consecutive games for the XP and coins, 10 stamina for 40 tickets.
nm-399	Get the fuck out of here, EA!
nm-400	But now it just doesn’t make sense. You only get 1 ticket per match, and if you are lucky, you will get 10 extra in every 20 matches.
nm-400	Only in leg or WC 1.
nm-400	This tournament was the one thing free-to-play was always able to do because of the low cost of entrance and the rewards were good enough compared to how many matches you need to play.
nm-400	You got a player extra and if you don’t like him, use it as XP.
nm-401	[Suggestion] if you don’t like the new WT, then don’t play it.
nm-402	Closed tech support?
nm-402	It’s, 1:30am and you’re a billion-dollar, global enterprise.
nm-402	What the literal fuck?
nm-402	Was your heating bill too much this month so you can’t make your rent?
nm-402	You mismanaged bunch of fools.
nm-403	So, long story short, I forgot to fill out the housing application for the fall ’22 semester, and I’m on the waitlist since April.
nm-403	Housing isn’t guaranteed when you’re not a freshman, and my income isn’t enough for rent so…
nm-403	There’s a possibility, I might be homeless.
nm-404	My answer is simple: Have you seen the men nowadays?
nm-404	No fucking competition.
nm-404	Most men this day are thirsty as fuck.
nm-404	The era of gentlemen is over.
nm-404	They are either idiots, look like a half-assed rapper or are complete assholes.
nm-404	Often times all of that.
nm-404	In their primitive brains, they grab and grunt at everything with two legs.
nm-404	And I mean that literally.
nm-404	But – that’s good for you.
nm-404	If you just behave like a decent human being, then you are already better than 80% of the other dudes.
nm-405	I (24M), an accountant at a traveling company.
nm-405	We ask our clients to pay their debts weekly, and today I called one of our agents and a girl picked up.
nm-405	She was their accountant and asked her if they will pay their debts, and she said “yes, I will be at your company at 21:00”.
nm-405	I said “ok, and at 21:00, she came by and asked who is the accountant”.
nm-405	I said “I am, please follow me to the room”.
nm-405	She came and I asked her how much did she bring.
nm-405	She said “I have $1300 with me”, which will not cover all of their debts by the way, so I brought a receipt and wrote down the amount and the company name and then I asked her for her name.
nm-405	She smiled and looked at me and said my name.
nm-406	So none of my friends are answering me 😭😭
nm-406	So, it’s time to make some new ones!
nm-406	I’m in the mood to call, so let me know if you’re down!
nm-406	Looking to talk to people around my age.
nm-406	I’ve posted before so you can check out my profile for more info.
nm-406	I’m a little lazy right now 🥴
nm-406	Anyways, let me know what your favorite type of music is 🙃
nm-407	I had been wearing Lane Bryants Lounge Bras the past four-ish years, and so this was the first time in a very long time that I wore a bra with wire.
nm-407	So come Monday, I wore my new bra with wire that fit perfectly at the store, but after a few hours it felt so uncomfortable!
nm-407	I am worried I wasted my money… :-(
nm-408	I’m so miserable and seriously just want to cancel my trip but don’t want to disappoint my husband.
nm-408	He’s been looking forward to a vacation for so long.
nm-408	I’m dreading the plane ride so bad!
nm-408	Luckily the flare is a bit higher and not right where I make contact when sitting, but it still hurts like a motherfucker.
nm-408	I’m going to be walking around in 40 degree weather with a big angry boil on my ass.
nm-408	God help me 😫
nm-409	Hey, there.
nm-410	Hi guys, I was drinking with my friends from the US and my boyfriend and everyone’s fallen asleep, and I want to play some truth or dare or drink, so if you have Discord or Kik, just message me, owo
nm-411	So I just had my baby with the man of my dreams 4 months ago :-) and it felt like I was living my fairytale life.
nm-411	I was in my exact vision I had, but then, long story short, postpartum with new emotions had me pull a crazy move and I checked his phone about a month ago now, only to find out he was meeting up with a  chick, doing favors for her, spending time in her room and texting a lot, all while I was pregnant.
nm-411	Now he and her both say they are just friends and never hooked up (yes, I contacted her number), lol, but I don’t want to lose my man, though I also saw he has dating profiles and he says he doesn’t do it all the time.
nm-411	And he won’t do it anymore.
nm-411	I don’t want my baby’s parents to split, plus I love him and want our vision to carry on.
nm-411	But how?
nm-411	Please help.
nm-411	Can I? Or should I trust him again ?
nm-412	Day 17 of posting Corgi stuff (sorry for not posting for so long)
nm-413	I have insomnia and I can’t sleep at night, and it’s just like I have so many ideas at night that just so many ideas keeping my up at night.
nm-413	Please tell me how sometimes I can get better sleep.
nm-413	Because of that, I almost failed school and because of skipped lessons, and people tell me to listen, but just, like, I talk with somebody, and then I just think of something.
nm-413	I forgot what I was about to say, and I had a math tutor, but iI couldn’t focus and just also my mind is like chaos people.
nm-413	Tell me.
nm-413	Oh, I don’t want to take medication and I’m sensitive to medicine.
nm-414	Digital cameras are either super expensive, or the type of camera you would use for vlogging or things like that.
nm-414	She probably already has one also.
nm-414	A real digital movie camera costs so damn much.
nm-414	So I opted for an analog one.
nm-414	Now, 8mm/Super 8 have an affordable price, 16mm doesn’t cost much, and 35mm costs a lot, so I think I’m going for a Super 8.
nm-414	But then how does it work?
nm-414	lol, I mean, I buy her a Super 8, but I should also buy her a video recorder, and some VHS… things like that.
nm-414	I don’t know how it works.
nm-414	Please can someone explain to me what should I do.
nm-415	How do you guys do it?
nm-415	It’s so scary, but I want to last forever with him, and I know I can’t tell the future, but we’ve been through so much together.
nm-415	How do you guys keep it going through all the obstacles life throws at you... how?
nm-416	Do you want to run some Minecraft? XD
nm-417	I’m bored and my friends are busy or out right now, so...
nm-418	I finished the game for the first time today.
nm-418	What a wonderful and amazing game.
nm-418	It hits right in the feels and fucks your mind up at times.
nm-418	My ending was sad.
nm-418	Kara and Alice die (I am bad at controls), North dies, Hank dies, Marcus is successful, but I let Connor kill him, because I guess I was doing kind of a role-play where Connor is the villain and the outcome is realistic.
nm-418	I will try to open other openings.
nm-418	But yes, the game was so good.
nm-419	Hi guys, this year was my third year at Glastonbury, and I loved it so much and hope you guys did too!
nm-420	I am an aspiring doctor/medical student, and so seeing a lot of medicine-related subjects as early in our first semester I was so excited.
nm-420	Then UPCA results came in, surprise!
nm-420	I passed for UPLB BS Biology!
nm-420	To be honest though, this wasn’t my priority program, so of course I had mixed emotions.
nm-420	I was elated to finally be a scholar, but I was also worried, because I’m not really as interested in Biology as invested I already was in Physical Therapy.
nm-420	Sure, I could learn to love Biology, sure I could transfer to UPM the next year, but that’s not certain.
nm-421	I will play with anyone on 2K21.
nm-421	I’m an 87 over 3 level scorer. As one that will play with anyone, REP and OVR don’t matter.
nm-421	I have no one to play with most of the time, and no randoms want to play with me.
nm-421	Please play with me.
nm-421	I promise I won’t sell.
nm-421	I can shoot.
nm-421	I have an 81 three, but I can shoot.
nm-421	I’m a shooting guard.
nm-422	I need someone who knows how to land planes on PC to help me.
nm-422	That’s all.
nm-422	I just need you to land the plane.
nm-422	I know how to do the rest of the mission, but the plane has been messing me up for hours.
nm-422	Please help as soon as possible.
nm-422	My discord is SingSong254.
nm-422	Contact me there, then I’ll give you my Ubisoft account information.
nm-422	Thanks.
nm-423	Help, I need someone who knows how to fly planes well on PC to join me.
nm-423	Let’s fucking go!
nm-424	What’s up guys?
nm-424	I drop around 30 kills a game right now, and I’m trying to get out of low ranks and get into Platinum.
nm-424	If you’re good at the game but simply don’t have a Stack, add me on Discord and we can rank up together.
nm-425	Just to clarify, when I say “anything” I mean anything within the FM’s current power.
nm-425	So no answers like “remove the nukes” or “boot the royals”.
nm-425	We cannot do that (not yet at least…).
nm-426	You become the first minister tomorrow and you can do anything without repercussions.
nm-426	What do you do?
nm-427	Me and my real life friends need a team that we (or especially I) can VOD review in order to learn about tarping, switching layers and positioning.
nm-427	I was thinking Wolf/Soldier/Wilkinson but I’m not sure if there are any better ones.
nm-427	Preferably EU as we are EU, and some stuff happening is basically exclusive to EU, lol, but I guess it could be NAE as well.
nm-427	Thank you!
nm-428	Looking for someone to play with right now.
nm-428	No toxics and no obnoxious people.
nm-428	I don’t fuck with that.
nm-428	18+ NAE.
nm-428	I just play for fun.
nm-428	You can be bad.
nm-428	I don’t care about skills 😇
nm-429	One word I simply can’t say properly is water...
nm-429	It actually hurts my brain trying to add the T, and I sound American if I do or still say wut-ta.
nm-429	I don’t know why it’s so hard for me to say, to be honest.
nm-429	I was just wondering what people’s thoughts are when you meet people who drop H’s and have glottal stops.
nm-430	So I got a Sky Q Mini Box for upstairs.
nm-430	It doesn’t work.
nm-430	I have to wait until late March for an engineer.
nm-430	lol
nm-431	So I will be starting a job next week and desperately need to move down to the city its based out off, as a daily commute is impossible.
nm-431	Looking for single bedroom flats or flat-shares is a legitimate issue as three letting agents in the city own them all, and are only letting to students.
nm-432	Vacuum won’t stop sucking. Please send help. Is it going to blow?
nm-433	Basically, if you didn’t know what that is, it’s basically an example of two sentences.
nm-433	One says “Let’s eat granny” making it seem like someone’s going to eat their nan.
nm-433	However, the other example says “Lets eat, granny”, implying a different meaning to the sentence.
nm-433	A pretty creative way to teach kids to use commas, I guess.
nm-434	I literally couldn’t have been more at fault
nm-434	I just drove straight into this woman’s Golf while changing lanes (it was raining and I did not see it).
nm-434	She seemed nice but understandably pissed.
nm-434	She took my insurance and my number and said it’s my choice if I want to go through insurance and she would call me.
nm-434	The crash damage was minute to my car and I think to hers as well, just very minor body work and paint, maybe a small dent.
nm-435	What broadband do I get?
nm-435	I’ve had Virgin for 8 years, and holy shit, is it slow for £40 monthly.
nm-435	Is it the old router or do I just switch to a cheaper BT or whatever?
nm-436	Jeans, T-shirt, steel-cap boots, boiler suit (lol), high vis, gloves, goggles, dust mask, ear protection.
nm-436	Help. I’m melting…
nm-436	Edit: the heat has got to my spelling ability first. The end is nigh.
nm-437	I’m sure as eggs is eggs that I’m not the only one that goes to the gas pump, and I want say £10, 9 times out of 10 it will go £10.01.
nm-437	Bloody things are rigged like a slot machine, I swear, lol.
nm-438	lol - small acknowledgement of a joke you sort of enjoyed but didn’t actually laugh to.
nm-438	LOL - adults and people who don’t really know how the internet works use this
nm-438	Lol - I’m not sure why this came up, but it’s likely an autocorrect, but if anyone types this on purpose they are probably a huge dweeb.
nm-438	Business-lol is what it has been named.
nm-438	LoL - Grandma lol, confused with lots of love.
nm-438	It’s also confusing because of League of Legends.
nm-438	loool - now, I think my girlfriend pronounces this, but she says that this one would rhyme with “spool”, but I think it’s the drawn-out “o”.
nm-438	So yeah, I think this is actual lols, she thinks it doesn’t exist.
nm-438	lolll - when I hear her say “loool”, this is what she says she is actually saying.
nm-438	I sort of get it. but I still think that’s “loool”,
nm-438	You can’t repeatedly pronounce a consonant.
nm-439	So, when is Big Ben going to bong again?
nm-440	But the filters cost £15 a pop!
nm-440	Can anyone reccomend one?
nm-440	Preferably under £50!
nm-440	Also, does anyone have tips on how to reduce dust in my house that are not energy consuming (that don’t require me to stand for lengths of time).
nm-440	I have just bought tumble dryer balls to hopefully help reduce lint on my clothing.
nm-440	It seems no matter what I do, I literally can’t keep the dust at bay for more than 24 hours, and I am losing my mind.
nm-441	It’s 10pm, 28°C, and my bum is literally melting.
nm-442	Saturday session three and chat.
nm-443	If this bear isn’t named Beary McBearface, we have failed as a society.
nm-444	It’s 32°C here inside my flat.
nm-444	I have taken the t-shirt off and soaked it in cold water.
nm-444	I’m wearing it.
nm-444	What genius ways are you keeping cool whilst working from home or somewhere extremely hot with no AC?
nm-445	Bloody lovely fucking weather, isn’t it?
nm-446	16 hours in Wetherspoons.
nm-447	Okay, so I went out with my girlfriend to go to 7-11 and I had my hair in my face, a hoodie, and a mask, and someone called me he/him.
nm-447	Bruh, I’m so happy right now, what the fuck (I’m non-binary and use all pronouns, but nobody has ever used he/him for me and it feels really good)
nm-448	To the neighbor that went out of their way just to check on me, I appreciate that.
nm-449	I just wanted to say from one Gen Z to Millennials, good on you guys.
nm-449	I hope you find what you’re looking for. It’s been fun being your little buddies in life.
nm-450	Remember, there’s a lot of fish in the sea!
nm-451	As somebody that doesn’t experience a lot of positive moments, this subreddit does make me smile :-)
ns-0	My favorite Obama quote: “Michael and I also want to… uh… acknowledge… uh… uh… uh… your son Jack, who deployed today.”
ns-1	New-ish player, couple of questions about parrying, etc.
ns-2	Basically the title.
ns-2	We’re both xxx majors (I’m a dual xxx and yyy major while she’s a xxx major and yyy minor, so we are taking 2-3 classes together every semester until graduation in May 2018).
ns-2	While I wouldn’t say I’m smarter than her, things tend to come more naturally to me, and I’m a good test-taker, while she has a lot of test anxiety (she will often get questions wrong that me and her practice right before the exam, will freak out about not having a formula that was on the formula sheet, etc.), but she easily studies more than I do.
ns-3	Me [20F] with my friend [23F] of 2-3 years, we’re both in college together, and she gets massively down on herself every time she takes an exam.
ns-3	It’s driving me crazy, how to deal with it?
ns-4	Her: Oh, where’s this ice luge, haha?
ns-4	Me: Probably my friend’s hotel room or wherever he can find a place for it.
ns-4	Me:
ns-4	I came to <insert city> with my fraternity and a sorority – that’s why he’s getting it.
ns-4	Her: Gotcha!
ns-4	Her: What fraternity and sorority I’m in xxx.
ns-4	Me: yyy.
ns-4	sorority is zzz.
ns-4	Me: You’re interesting though.
ns-4	I want to hang out with you.
ns-4	When this week?
ns-4	Her: Uh, maybe Friday?
ns-4	Me: Ah, yes.
ns-4	Me: Friday.
ns-4	*one day later*
ns-4	Me: <girl’s name>, we’re hanging out tomorrow, right?
ns-5	How to go from number to date?
ns-6	I just pretty much dismissed what she said by saying a vibe is not captured by pre-googling and confirmed the time that I’ll be there.
ns-6	If she gives any further resistance, I think I’ll just next her, ignore her, not respond to her, agree with her that she can’t handle the place, or tease her about the crazy high standards she has for a first freaking date.
ns-7	This is a nagging annoyance I have with the Word text object.
ns-7	Suppose the cursor is located in the “aaa” word, and I want to yank four words without selecting the spaces after “ddd”: > xxx **aaa bbb ccc ddd** yyy
ns-8	It is the bar with the team composition and the status of each character that is used to follow “report team” (like in the actual World Cup).
ns-8	It can be tweaked down to not reveal too much information about the red team, but it will make following the killfeed easier, and you won’t have to use tab.
ns-9	The part I’m humming is like “word word word wo-o-o-ord” twice.
ns-9	So he draws out the 4th (?) word.
ns-9	I think it was something like “fly-y-y-yyy.”
ns-9	I’m pretty sure it’s a popular song; I’ve heard it many times.
ns-9	Thanks!
ns-10	I’m having trouble with if / then / else / end in a repeat loop.
ns-11	Haha. Oh my god, it’s terribly funny!
ns-12	I went grocery shopping.
ns-12	I’m down to my last dollars soon, and I can’t just eat beer and cigarettes.
ns-12	Then I set them down so I didn’t have to carry them across the street to get beer (it’s cheaper at Adventure’s First Stop).
ns-12	Then I walked back and forgot my groceries.
ns-12	I walked all the way home and, ah shit, I’m getting shin splints from all this walking up and down the hill.
ns-12	I live on a hill.
ns-12	Down.
ns-12	In the middle, really.
ns-12	I imagine it’s like an amateur San Francisco.
ns-12	So I walked back and got them.
ns-12	No crime round these parts.
ns-12	Not much, anyway.
ns-13	I hope the title makes sense.
ns-13	I have a list of names “john.baker” (no spacing between names other than the period) and need it broken into 2 columns “john” and “baker”.
ns-13	Thanks!
ns-14	I have to break up the format “xxx.yyy” into two separate columns “xxx” and “yyy”.
ns-15	I am confused. What’s going on, lol?
ns-15	This is my first time with SFU e-mail.
ns-15	After the semester I haven’t touched anything school-related until today heh, so I don’t know how to fix this.
ns-16	Even better for me it would be: It would be an unbelievable loss to let a broken and thus spilt bottle be wasted with no return.
ns-16	So to show my sincerest apologies for bumping straight into a noble that half-marched in his drunken stupor down the sidewalk, straight out of a liquor store and making him drop his bottle worth more than what I suppose one of the merchants off the main street makes in a month, I was invited to finish the wasted goods, lest they spoil any further.
ns-16	“Yes sir!
ns-16	May the heavens cry before your merciful heart!”
ns-16	“Now get lost!
ns-16	This is no place for disease-ridden vermin like you.”
ns-16	“Of course my lord!”
ns-16	I ran back down the alley I squirmed my way out of.
ns-16	Filled to the brim with anger and shame.
ns-16	Sidestreets and alleyways, down I went.
ns-16	Further and further out of sight.
ns-17	He, as soon as he saw that I was weeping, answered, “Come with me.”
ns-17	Onward he moved, I close his steps pursued.
ns-17	Entering, he led me with him on the bounds of a great circle itself encircling a great abyss.
ns-17	Ere, I beheld an uneven land covered with lava pyramids, with sickly farms of melons and carrots, near barren of life save for those imprisoned in it, who, though they surrounded us, dared not approach for fear of the master.
ns-17	As my ear could note, the sound was heard of screams, cries, and explosions that made the eternal air tremble, caused by slaughter, starvation, withering, and frief felt by those multitudes, many and vast, of men, women, and children.
ns-18	I recently returned to D2 after several year, now I’m wondering: Where do you guys sell or buy your stuff?
ns-18	Do you just make a game “O xxx N yyy” and hope for the best?
ns-18	Or is there a website that’s more efficient?
ns-19	Who is a former (or still) important person in your country, that constantly compromises himself/herself on social media?
ns-20	It’s not until my next billing cycle that I noticed something was off.
ns-20	I was a bit lower than normal and I keep a very close eye on my expenses.
ns-20	I looked over my bank statements and there it was: My new Prime bill.
ns-20	I was super confused and got hold of Amazon’s customer support.
ns-20	They helped me as much as they could, but because I was receiving my service through the phone company, I would have to go though them and figure out the problem.
ns-20	The next day that I had off, I walked in and talked to a very sweet girl, who tried to understand what my problem was.
ns-20	We kind of talked in circles for a bit as I tried to explain what the Amazon customer service told me.
ns-20	We looked me up in their system and there I was: 2 lines, but no Prime membership for either one of us.
ns-20	She could see the date I opened my first line and then the second.
ns-20	Both dates added up to what I had told her before.
ns-20	She stared at the computer screen for a while with a confused look on her face.
ns-21	Anyways, these terrible memories kept haunting me, so yesterday I finally mustered up the courage to message him.
ns-21	Me: Hey, how’s everything?
ns-21	Him: It’s been a long time.
ns-21	Me: Sorry about last year.
ns-21	I was super awkward around you, lol.
ns-21	Him: lol, no, don’t worry about it.
ns-21	*drum roll please*
ns-21	Me: To be honest, I liked you blah blah blah…
ns-21	Him: Haha, you could’ve just told me!
ns-21	Next time you see me just say hi.
ns-21	Do you still go to <school>?
ns-21	I’m not like r/Nicegirls but that reply didn’t sit well with me.
ns-22	I’m out, boys :-)
ns-23	Now I obviously can’t get out and shut it on the main road, so I pull down a few side streets and ensure that no one fucking knows I’ve quickly jumped out and shut it.
ns-23	I jump back in and drive home like nothing’s happened.
ns-24	I don’t remember specifically which, I think both bugs do it, but here in Florida, there’s a particular bug that makes a loud sound 100 times longer than when it’s not making a sound.
ns-24	I’d describe it as that trademark desert ambiance sound.
ns-25	Locusts, grasshoppers, etc. can shut the hell up.
ns-26	I’ve searched far and wide across the internet with nothing to show for it.
ns-26	They could even go woah eee ahh ahh/oh eee ahh.
ns-26	The possibilities are endless and I know it’s hard.
ns-26	I’m just wondering if anyone knows it, thanks!
ns-27	What to do: my plant’s now way too small for its age in my opinion and has started to grow pistils.
ns-27	Should I chop and restart or…?
ns-28	How do you get destiny delicacies?
ns-28	I’ve seen a few people have them, but I’ve never got one.
ns-28	I don’t know where you get them.
ns-28	If anyone knows, it would be a lot of help :-)
ns-29	Every time I listen to him, shit makes so much sense, even though I don’t know what he is talking about.
ns-29	That leads me to believe that either that guy is a genius who can articulate what’s going on in the economy right now in a brilliant way, or he may be missing something.
ns-29	I mean what should I listen to if I really want to find out the truth, if Schiff is just “biased toward gold”, and that’s the reason why he is so hard on the current economy, etc.
ns-30	This wouldn’t be an issue if all your servers asked at the beginning “do you guys want a separate check so it won’t be awkward.”
ns-30	Also, why restaurants have to be set up like that?
ns-30	Why can’t you just get up to the cashier and pay for your fucking share of the food?
ns-30	Why can’t you just get up to the cashier and pay for your fucking share of the food?
ns-31	So I don’t know why I got on everyone’s nerves about the separate checks…
ns-32	But every time, my narcissistic mom says that it can’t be true, because when she was my age, her periods were 3 days long and super light.
ns-32	“It barely ever affected me, so how can it be affecting you so much?”
ns-32	Um, I don’t know, maybe it’s because we’re different people with different bodies?
ns-33	Does anyone else’s narcissistic mom treat you like you’re overreacting about your period pains?
ns-34	I passed my FAA PPL written!
ns-35	Alright everyone, I think I mis-tagged this earlier, so I’m trying again.
ns-35	I got some not fun fungal acne from running daily with a face mask on my chin/jawline, forehead, and lower cheeks.
ns-35	Once I identified it, I switched from a face mask to a face shield while running (I have no issue with being over 12 feet from other people - I usually don’t pass anyone on my runs anyways), and then I have used the following routine to nuke it over the course of 3 weeks.
ns-36	I had never heard of this “influencer” before and consider myself pretty internet savvy.
ns-36	I then lost interest in her, because her Instagram wasn’t that interesting.
ns-36	She popped back on my radar with the Nancy thread, and then she disappeared from my mind again until the Anna article came out, and then I took a great interest in checking in on her, because I just found her funny and her antics amusing (in a sad way).
ns-36	So this has been on my mind for a while: How does she continue to have such loyal fans who will send her lots of money, because she claims to not be able to afford food or rent or whatever, when there is photographic evidence all over her apartment of her bougie taste in decor, perfumes (Byredo perfume costs anywhere from $200-300 a pop), shit tons of plants and flowers, which aren’t cheap.
ns-37	Basically, I just found out that this 1 girl is only snapping me again because my friend basically told her to (told a friend to tell her), and now I’m 99% sure she’s just snapping me to be nice (plus the delivery times and opened times shit are mad long).
ns-38	What should I do from here? Someone please let me know.
ns-39	Like, I don’t really care what mean, shit people on the internet say.
ns-39	But when I got nobody in real life, all I have is the internet, and it does kind of hurt a bit when I just want to vent my problems.
ns-39	And I’d be fine if it got maybe a single upvote and no comments, and I’d be fine.
ns-39	But instead, it’s full of people saying
ns-40	I don’t like when people type huge paragraphs or dump a lot of stress on me about their problems.
ns-40	I don’t like when people mumble on the phone or if they ramble on, and it’s all about them.
ns-41	I’m talking about “ppl” instead of people “u” or “ur” instead of “you” or “your”, “tho” instead of “though” and so on.
ns-41	It’s getting old, and you look like an idiot when you spell like this.
ns-41	Just type out the word.
ns-41	It isn’t hard.
ns-42	Maybe a little earlier, I don’t know, because I’m usually at work, but my download speed is now stuck at the 64mb/s range.
ns-42	Now I understand at peak times it should drop, I even understand that since more people are at home I’m going to see lower numbers, but to go from 500 to 60…
ns-43	I’m curious how likely it is that a post on my personal space will be shown to people. Please write “+” in the comment if you see this.
ns-44	Hm, mandatory title.
ns-45	If anyone says anything remotely offensive on the internet, everyone just has to say you can die or something.
ns-45	Do we really care that much?
ns-45	Not really, to be honest.
ns-46	Damn, some people need to stop overreacting to stuff on the internet, Jesus!
ns-47	I’ve come up with a list of all the questions I could think about (there’s kind of a lot, lol), so I would really appreciate it if someone would take the time to answer them.
ns-47	If anyone is willing to PM me and chat about their test day experience and answer all my questions, that would be great too!
ns-48	I’m gross and only brush in the morning.
ns-48	I guess I don’t see the need, because who the fuck cares?
ns-49	But now it seems that you’re all making grits without the butter and making us madder than a wet hen, I must say!
ns-49	We were preparing to tour more plantations than Carter’s got little pills but you done gone and brought up them “slave owners” now.
ns-49	It isn’t amounting to anything more than a hill of beans!
ns-49	If I had my druthers, I’d have just taken my business over yonder to the white-friendly plantation and learnt something decent about history.
ns-49	All this chicanery has got me worn slap out!
ns-49	You get along now, do you hear?
ns-50	How do I break off a relationship with my “friend”?
ns-51	Basically, I put my skate account in my Instagram biography, because I have no posts on my main, and I’m kind of insecure about my body (in some of my clips I’m shirtless, and people won’t expect me to be like shredded or some shit if they add me), and today I got 3 followers (girls from different towns who don’t know me).
ns-51	I’m really picky though, because I don’t want to have a relationship, unless I actually feel like I’d really like the person and be into them a lot, so I didn’t follow any of them back.
ns-52	Bro, I’ve been added and un-added on Instagram so many times today that it’s kind of a confidence boost, lmao.
ns-53	Honestly, most of the posts or memes here are either from people who read the novels or the manga.
ns-53	I have to dodge so many spoilers, smh… I have nothing else to say, come at me angry people, lmao.
ns-54	Hi guys, I’m a casual just-for-fun gamer, playing 5-6 games a week.
ns-54	Yesterday it was just pure horror division 10…
ns-54	I could not win 1 game out of 6…
ns-54	Like, is everyone smurfing ? Or what’s going on?
ns-54	I know people want to play the objective.
ns-54	I get that, but why do you need to shush or watch full replay or every cut scene?
ns-55	So basically, for my A-levels I got 82 RP and wanted to go the NUS business administration but didn’t get in, though I’m quite sure my grade is good enough, and my appeal was rejected 3 days ago…
ns-55	*welp
ns-55	* :-(
ns-55	I got into SMU business administration, but I still feel damn shit that I didn’t get into NUS, so help change my mind and convince me why SMU is better than NUS, especially for business :-/
ns-55	I’m most scared that in the future when I’m working, people will look down on SMU like elitism discrimination all that, I don’t know, man.
ns-55	Or will they pay less or not even hire me?
ns-55	RIP, because SMU is kind of 2nd best and less well known.
ns-55	I would really appreciate if you all could help me out, especially those who are currently at university or have already left.
ns-55	Thanks pals :-)
ns-55	TLDR: the title.
ns-56	Other vegans that you’re friends with tell you that they don’t tell other people that they’re vegan.
ns-56	Like, they purposefully avoid it.
ns-56	I feel like it fucks over the vegan community, because they are probably the people that would be more gentle with their words, which is what some people need in order to listen.
ns-56	I’m a very straightforward, no sugarcoating type of person, and although some people appreciate it, a lot more get upset and start trying to put words in my mouth and twisting things.
ns-57	Fellow vegans, does it annoy you when...
ns-58	You honestly deserve to get scammed if you give a random guy on the internet like €300 worth of fake internet points, like, what the fuck are you doing, honestly? lol
ns-59	Why would you give awards to people? lol
ns-60	Yes, I agree things like Tumblr made-up identities are weird, and some people do get offended easily, but if what you said is ignorant/bigoted, calling people snowflakes is just weak.
ns-61	Give yourself a pat on your back if you believed and trusted Tom from the start to the end without any unsureness and trusted him and never lost hope in the series!
ns-61	Props to you!
ns-62	The New Year’s Eve Raticate with a hat.
ns-62	I haven’t found him anywhere yet.
ns-62	Does anyone want to raid?
ns-62	I need a few people quick.
ns-63	Stop.
ns-63	I think what I am trying to say… this game is not hard.
ns-63	Don’t make it hard yourself.
ns-63	The main objective, as I understood, is to get the dragon, and don’t die before that.
ns-63	Even better if you outfarm your opponent.
ns-63	Just don’t die.
ns-63	And trades in lane… if you see the enemy using his escape ability or even damage ability.
ns-64	And I offered to go out to look at Christmas lights, but he was out of town.
ns-64	So we couldn’t do that, and now he’s back in town, and I asked him what he’s doing on New Year’s Eve and he said he was going to hang out with two of the managers from our work.
ns-64	And like, he didn’t offer an invite, and then he said if he cancels with them, would I like to come over, and I just said I don’t know what I’m doing yet, so I don’t know.
ns-64	Am I overthinking this?
ns-64	Does he not care?
ns-65	There are going to be people on the internet saying “stat padder” but other than his weird hesitancy to drive, he played pretty solid.
ns-66	Hey, the regulars!
ns-66	I just wanted to say that I love the group channel, it’s amazing, and love your own channels as well.
ns-66	I love all your videos, and I have a suggestion for a video for the channel: Do a Minecraft build battle and whoever loses there, the other people get to write something on their Twitter, lol.
ns-66	I hope you like my idea and can use it for a video.
ns-67	I have a group chat.
ns-67	It’s on Discord for people who are bored or want to chat about anything.
ns-67	We already have some people who chat and stuff about anything.
ns-67	It’s chill, edgy, and if you want to join, comment and I’ll direct message you the link.
ns-68	I just kind of realized that I’ve never had New Year’s Eve plans...
ns-68	I always think about how I haven’t been able to throw birthday parties or shit like that…
ns-68	I recently realized that I still don’t have enough friends to have one for my 21st coming up…
ns-68	I don’t know why I didn’t clue into this though.
ns-68	Like, I never thought about how people have traditions for this night, besides my sister, who goes out to her friends’ every year.
ns-68	It’s funny that Covid isn’t affecting my New Year at all…
ns-68	Is anyone else in the same boat?
ns-68	Anyway, I guess I’ll just watch a movie tonight, lol.
ns-69	Hello, I’m looking for people to talk to, maybe play some games or watch anime together.
ns-69	Just please be aware that I’m not very good at upholding conversations.
ns-69	uwu F/20
ns-70	Like, I see videos on YouTube on it.
ns-70	But like, I can’t see any mention on the design notes, etc. Where do people get the information from?
ns-71	DM me to debate.
ns-71	Please be well learned in your belief.
ns-71	I want DMs, because it’ll get deep and I can’t reply to 300 people like that.
ns-71	Also, I need 500 characters so here come the blah blahs.
ns-72	I’m not saying that they should be ashamed to be turned into girls or that I’m being stereotypical towards a person being a girl, but I am saying that they won’t like to do it, because they are humans with their own choices, and not agreeing to be a girl isn’t making them a women anti.
ns-72	Like, how many guys around you would be willing to be turned into Disney princesses or to play that butt game?
ns-72	Maybe they get used to this with time but how much time?
ns-72	And maybe they know that they have to do all this for the entertainment of fans.
ns-72	But knowing this isn’t making anything better for them until they happily and genuinely agree to it.
ns-72	I sometimes feel sad for them when they are asked to do all this.
ns-72	I wouldn’t like it if you tried to make me a man and wanted me to dance in front of so many people, even though I am a tomboy.
ns-73	Is anyone missing me?
ns-73	If you miss a Reddit friend, read this.
ns-73	It could be me!
ns-74	So I just hopped on PC from PS4, not even 2.5k games played there.
ns-74	I played a few decent games since I frankly suck with a keyboard and mouse, and yet for the past week or so I am matching with people 2000 kills and predators even.
ns-74	Yet I haven’t even a hundred games played and about 80 kills with all characters.
ns-74	I’m not really having fun anymore.
ns-74	I can’t improve if I get shit on every game.
ns-75	I see a lot of people on here who seem hella sad, so if you’re really sad, I’m up for a chat.
ns-75	So yeah if you are up for a chat, or long-term friendship, I’ll be more than happy to do so.
ns-76	So I always see people talk about sending designs and edits to Affinity, but how do I do that?
ns-76	I’ve worked at OD for almost a year and none of management has mentioned it.
ns-76	Like not even the print suppliers.
ns-76	We do every type of editing in store and I hate it.
ns-76	Like we’re out here doing stuff that I’m pretty sure is supposed to get sent out to Affinity based on what I see on here.
ns-76	But yeah, is more of this information on the store portal or where can I learn more?
ns-76	I’m extremely tired of creating/editing shit for last-minute, rude customers :-)
ns-77	One person in the server was selling the set for 100k, and I was like “Hell no, that’s not worth 100k”, like bruh.
ns-78	Why do people find the new set expensive?
ns-79	I know the girl I posted about is a troll people, but oh well, she’s got her 6 minutes of fame time to take the posts down.
ns-80	Hit me up with a chat message.
ns-80	Tell me about yourself and we can go from there.
ns-81	I don’t understand how people can build what they do...
ns-81	I love building but I guess my creativity isn’t well tuned as a lot of people’s is, and it bothers me that I can’t build amazing stuff.
ns-81	I know I could if had the creative side, ugh!
ns-81	I just tend to give up after a while and settle for simple crap to pass for ok.
ns-82	I care about how I affect people a lot but try not to show it.
ns-82	It’s hard for me to join in conversations with big groups of people, which is related to ADHD.
ns-82	Sometimes my sensitivity can make me kind of stand-offish to people I don’t know.
ns-82	I’ll try to act like I don’t care if someone doesn’t like me but drunk people will fall to the floor begging them to.
ns-82	These all are ADHD things though, because of rejection sensitive dysphoria.
ns-82	I’m a good listener.
ns-82	A lot of people view me as really cute or innocent.
ns-82	I can have a really, really, really flirty personality at times.
ns-82	I remember in high school, my friend’s mom said I had the “personality”, so I’d probably be the first to have a boyfriend.
ns-83	But when she’s in the wrong or when someone holds her accountable, she just throws the biggest temper tantrum ever and just disrespects anyone/everyone who doesn’t agree with her and screams about how she doesn’t care.
ns-83	Or more specifically in her words “I don’t give a fuck”.
ns-83	She’ll never take accountability or apologize and becomes the biggest hypocrite.
ns-83	All the things she screams at people to not do to her, she turns around and does the exact same rude, petty shit to anyone/everyone else that doesn’t agree with her.
ns-83	I think the main reason she does this is because my sister acts just like my mom, and my mom can’t stand it/accept that So she becomes downright nasty.
ns-84	In class, I’ve usually been really quiet, but sometimes I’ll meet someone I click with in class and be really, really chatty.
ns-84	I think I get along best with girly fun girls, overly confident queen B, feisty type people, and just gossipy people.
ns-84	My friends and their families see me as really bubbly and excitable.
ns-84	Although most people see me as sweet, soft spoken, and quiet.
ns-84	Some people think I never talk though.
ns-84	I’ve always been a smiley, happy person though.
ns-84	I do really like making others happy or seeing people I know and having a friendly conversation.
ns-84	I have ADHD.
ns-84	Sometimes I’m at a loss for words or boring.
ns-84	I’m really, really chatty when drunk.
ns-84	Although sometimes I’m not when drunk - I heard people with ADHD are both.
ns-85	Could I be ISTP?
ns-85	Help type me please.
ns-86	I don’t know if people would even want to.
ns-86	I just want to know if that’s allowed, and if not, where would be a good place to post that.
ns-86	(I’ve watched Dragonmar and other people’s videos but that would be hard to be a me-specific video on there)
ns-87	Like in a good way though.
ns-88	Some people are just indescribable.
ns-89	I haven’t done this before, but I’ve seen enough to get a gist of it so like…interests :-)
ns-89	We can definitely talk about anime (especially romance - I’m a sucker for it), we can talk about games and go into detail about lore and stuff, creepy stories go hard, and really I’m just down for anything :-)
ns-89	I’m not gonna be weird so long as you’re not weird.
ns-89	Any age or anything is fine with me and uh yeah… if I didn’t do this right let me know :-)
ns-89	Oh and I’ll absolutely talk more on Snap.
ns-90	I mean yeah, to be honest it is.
ns-90	I care about a lot of people and I can’t just... make people be happy.
ns-90	But like… I want to :-(
ns-91	I just want to make everybody I care about happy.
ns-91	Like, is that too much to ask?
ns-92	I think that some people here are AI or something.
ns-93	smh, don’t even try.
ns-93	I can do that by myself 🤠
ns-94	Hey, F/19, bored as fuck.
ns-94	I enjoy talking to new people.
ns-94	Hit me up!
ns-95	I started chatting with her and a co-worker of hers who was in high school in the late 90’s.
ns-95	She said everyone was watching wrestling back then, and it was a cool thing.
ns-95	Now no one gives a shit 😭 (I don’t really blame them sometimes).
ns-95	I asked her “why do you think people stopped liking it”, and she said “because it’s garbage.
ns-95	It’s come on Fox on Fridays and as soon as 7 o’clock hits, I change the channel”.
ns-95	I had to include that in there, because she’s so funny 😂😂😂
ns-95	Anyways…
ns-96	Hey, I can’t fall asleep and this platform seems pretty interesting.
ns-96	Hit me up if you think we could hit it off well.
ns-96	I hope we have a great time, future chat buddy ;-) 😁
ns-97	It’s kind of weird, I’m not going to lie.
ns-98	These motherfuckers can outrun, outswim or outstam (through venom) anything that tries to get them.
ns-98	Mine is literally covered in scars head to toe from escaped or successful fights.
ns-99	I just finished the show so I’m a little behind everyone but equally obsessed and want to talk about it so much, lol.
ns-99	Also by sidestory I mean something that’s not part of the main plot!
ns-100	One of the best games ever that I have played!
ns-100	But I have some problems…
ns-101	I’d always heard of Mac for years but never really checked him out in detail until a couple of months ago, and now he’s one of my favorite and most often listened to artists right now.
ns-101	Anyway, those were just my thoughts.
ns-101	Happy New Year’s everyone!
ns-101	I hope the new year treats you well.
ns-102	Now for this one, it’s kind of hard, because the enemies are so cool for this game, but...
ns-102	If I had to choose, I’d say I like the clown the most.
ns-102	I just think their design and movement is super neat.
ns-102	Plus they are one of the few if not the only enemy in the game that doesn’t have a single other variation from what I remember.
ns-103	Honestly, I wasn’t going to make one, but I want to at least give my two cents especially since I disagree with a lot of others’ lists.
ns-103	Not to say that my list is right, because this is all subjective anyway, which is why I hate making them.
ns-104	Here we go again, another character fighting tier list!
ns-104	Yay!
ns-105	In my opinion, Lily for the most part is a rather likeable character (keep in mind I’ve only played a bit of season 1 up to like part of episode 3).
ns-105	Unlike her father, Lily tries to work with Lee and for the most part the group.
ns-105	She does what she has to.
ns-105	She is a bit of a bitch, because she has to.
ns-105	I only have 1 problem with Lily.
ns-105	She killed Carly.
ns-105	If you could get Ben to confess… Yes, I got spoiled on that and a few other things.
ns-105	Ben is useless.
ns-105	He is what looks like a college student, yet he is useless and needs rescuing 24/7.
ns-105	Please don’t downvote me into oblivion if I missed something.
ns-106	I pretty much just use it for drums and I like making complex beats.
ns-106	So 4 isn’t really cutting it anymore and piano roll editing drums kind of sucks in my opinion.
ns-106	Is there a way to make the step sequencer into 8th or 16th notes in FL?
ns-107	I’m not a trans man, but I am interested in knowing someone’s perspectives who has lived both as a woman and as a man.
ns-107	(Not a lot of people get to experience what it is like to be perceived as both genders)
ns-107	So that’s kind of neat in my opinion.
ns-108	I don’t think he did the role justice.
ns-108	I feel before Neo figured it out, the way he was speaking was ok, but after… in my opinion, he should have gone full Hugo Weaving speech.
ns-109	I just wanted to share my opinion not being a United fan, on the game against Burnley.
ns-109	(Not that many of you will care).
ns-109	McTominay - sheesh, what a guy.
ns-109	I thought that Shaw was solid.
ns-109	Now you’ve got two good left backs in good form.
ns-109	Also I wanted to say AWB had a much better game, I thought.
ns-109	After the shitty games and Dalot playing well I personally thought AWB improved a lot.
ns-110	I would be fine if it was changed to tome can only drop at 4-6, Yes this also ties into the item drop timing issues, but for me I can live with those issues but not this.
ns-110	Please change!
ns-111	It’s kind of an odd question in my opinion, but I have a ball python who I just got to eat frozen/thawed for the first time (yay!), but she seems to prefer medium rats.
ns-111	I’ve tried frozen/thawed large rats with no success.
ns-111	First medium I offer and I got her to eat.
ns-111	It could be a fluke though.
ns-112	I know it’s like a meme or something of “Dark Souls player complains about the combat” or something similar, but I just don’t get the combat.
ns-112	I can do DS3 Deathless, I know how to parry at about above average skill, I have played a shit ton of Ghost of Tsushima lately.
ns-112	I know it’s not a difficult game, but hear me out real quick if you know the game.
ns-113	Oh my God!
ns-113	Why do so many morons try to download PC game torrents when firstly they don’t have any idea of how a torrent even works (it’s so damn easy though!).
ns-113	Comments like “The link doesn’t work”, rofl!
ns-113	Yes, it works completely fine!
ns-113	You’re just way too dumb to know you need a torrent program.
ns-114	😤 Idiot morons 😡😡🤬
ns-115	So I get tipped on the app, they gave me cash at the door, then took away the tip on the application after?
ns-115	What the fuck is even the point of that?
ns-115	This shit has never happened before, but now it’s happened 3 times this week.
ns-115	Once the cash tip was less than the app tip...
ns-115	If you are tipping both, tip both.
ns-116	Not going to lie, Teamfight Tactics is a good mode, but it’s like Hearthstone a good game to play on your phone, not something to grind out all day all night, like what the fuck?
ns-116	It’s not even that engaging (ideal game to turn on, prep up and alt tab until it’s next time you can do anything).
ns-116	Any thoughts?
ns-117	I know it’s a scientific things and all, but some of the posts there are just too much.
ns-117	Learning dream languages?
ns-117	What the fuck?
ns-117	And some bloke is saying “I tried the 3 jump and eat banana method but didn’t lucid dream?!” every few hours.
ns-117	Maybe the posts are just getting a little too imaginative?
ns-118	Like everyone is gathered and shows fake smile, fake dance, fake love and I am like “Dear lord, what the fuck is happening, ooh”.
ns-119	So I am a first time cup user, and I got the Saalt cup at Target.
ns-119	I decided to do a dry run in the shower today, and it went in pretty fine after a few different fold methods were attempted (C-fold + 17 year-old virgin = ow).
ns-119	I got it in with the 7-fold, and it may not have been perfect but a great first try.
ns-119	I go to take it out and how the fuck am I supposed to do this with my long ass acrylic nails?
ns-119	In one way, it kind of helped me find the cup lowkey grip, but god damn was it difficult trying not to stab myself.
ns-120	I didn’t think about nails...
ns-121	Is he going to tell her?
ns-121	If so how would that conversation go down?!
ns-122	Okay, what the fuck!
ns-122	Arlo now knows Sera (I don’t know how to spell her full name) is John’s weakness.
ns-123	First of all, we’ve seen they are greedy as fuck (OK, not as much other mobile studios, but still).
ns-123	Second, the game needs a lot of work to work well (even if it was designed for high-end phones).
ns-123	Even that (oh, Allah may forgive me) damn Fornite mobile is better optimized nowadays.
ns-124	What the fuck are you Yanks on?
ns-125	See also: (on an article about how it’s “40 degrees in some parts of Europe”) > what the fuck, lol, that’s not hot at all.
ns-125	Put on a jacket, dummies!
ns-125	(“[city] experiences average annual temperatures of 16°C”) > Oh my God, that’s really cold.
ns-125	I’m never moving to canada.
ns-126	Sometimes it will cause me to have racing thoughts, others it chills me the fuck out and gives me nods similar to codeine.
ns-126	Why the hell is this?
ns-126	I think it has something to do with whether or not a woman looks at me and thinks I’m ugly.
ns-126	If that happens, I get anxious from it.
ns-126	But if a women looks at me and feels indifferent and even thinks I’m decent looking, I get good effects from the stuff.
ns-126	What the fuck is going on?
ns-127	If you shoot an enemy then crouch to become invisible, even if they don’t detect you, they will waltz right over to exactly where you are.
ns-127	Sneak is garbage in this game.
ns-127	I should’ve just grabbed a submachine gun and power armor.
ns-128	I finally beat him after so many tries, most of them being on his second phase.
ns-128	His 3rd phase I beat first time.
ns-129	I got 7th place on the last event with Magaki but have 2960 points and get 50 frags instead of 80 for 7-10 place.
ns-129	Why?
ns-129	Because I have less than 3000 points.
ns-129	(I need 55 Magaki frags and I get 50 - just feel my suffering)
ns-129	Also in another event with gamer764 I have around 8000 points and got 4th place and got rewards for 4th place, not for 1st.
ns-129	What is it with needing 7k points or more?
ns-129	Are the developers too greedy?
ns-130	I made plans to go camping during a day we were going to see each other, and I got a bunch of texts on how she wished I was still free Wednesday, and so I canceled it, and now she won’t stop saying sorry that’s not what she meant.
ns-130	What the fuck do I do?
ns-130	I told her I was going on another one next month (lie) to make her feel better, but I didn’t.
ns-131	But I don’t necessarily need top of the line if that also means the light will be heavy and bulky.
ns-131	I prefer high speed, low drag equipment.
ns-131	Would prefer to use AA batteries rather than being tethered to 16850s.
ns-131	Can you recommend something?
ns-131	Thanks!
ns-132	Okay, so I’ve got less than a chapter left in Gardens of the Moon and I still can’t understand what the fuck Oponn is trying to achieve through all their/its meddling.
ns-132	Is there something I’m missing, is it continued in another book, or is it just a dead end?
ns-133	It actually got like 7 updoots.
ns-133	You all are whack.
ns-134	What the fuck!
ns-134	I posted a literal anime foot and still didn’t even make most controversial post of the day, let alone of all time.
ns-135	So huh, you can’t alpha Karthus ult? What the fuck is this bullshit?
ns-136	It would be very helpful if all of you original posters out there actually said what the fuck it was that everyone is talking about before going on a banter about it! Such as “now I understand why this [brand name] thing has everyone going crazy”…
ns-136	To someone that is not constantly in the loop about the different changes, that doesn’t mean much to me.
ns-136	If it’s too long to type, reference the original post, news article, video, whatever at the beginning of your post.
ns-137	And the scary thing, I am not in the “DFW teams are cursed” camp or a #FireJD type.
ns-137	However, some of this stuff is bugging me too much.
ns-137	When Corey Perry being signed by the Stars is not the biggest potential what the fuck transaction among DFW teams, that is a bad sign.
ns-138	I’m building a PC, but in the meantime I’m using a crappy 13-year-old PC.
ns-138	I got money for Rust, bought it and it took 4 hours to download, 1 hour to load and 5 hours to load a server.
ns-138	After I hit a tree with my rock, my game crashed.
ns-138	At this time it was 12:47 am and I just said fuck it and went to bed ready for a whole lot of shit today.
ns-139	EM opens the door: May I help you?
ns-139	Me:
ns-139	Yes!
ns-139	Why did you give your kid permission to enter my house without my permission?
ns-139	EM:
ns-139	GT just wanted Smores and to find treasure.
ns-139	GT pulls out one of the treasures from his backpack.
ns-139	My girlfriend’s face just turned red, because the treasure he found was her dildo.
ns-139	My girlfriend snatches that out of GT’s hand.
ns-139	GF:
ns-139	This isn’t meant for kids.
ns-139	GT:
ns-139	But it’s mine - I found it and finders keepers.
ns-139	EM: Give him back his treasure.
ns-139	Me:
ns-139	Why the fuck are you not watching your son, EM, because he has embarrassed my girlfriend and entered my home without permission.
ns-140	Stop!
ns-140	Me:
ns-140	Yes, ma’am.
ns-140	EM:
ns-140	What are you listening to?
ns-140	Me: Better Off Dead from Josh A.
ns-140	EM: What?!
ns-140	EK: mom, stop!
ns-140	Me: Bett-
ns-140	EM:
ns-140	I heard you.
ns-140	What is that cover?
ns-140	*points to album cover*
ns-140	Me:
ns-140	Oh, I think that’s a reference to cu-
ns-140	EM: *cuts me off again* to satanic ritual.
ns-140	Me: No, not at all.
ns-140	EK: Mom, please stop!
ns-140	EM:
ns-140	No, EK, this is a bad man.
ns-140	EM (to me): Now give me your phone.
ns-140	It was at this moment I knew this was a entitled parent.
ns-140	Me:
ns-140	No.
ns-140	EM:
ns-140	But my EK needs it.
ns-140	He’s got his degree.
ns-140	EK: Mom, I’m 10.
ns-140	Me:
ns-140	*coughs* Damn!
ns-140	EM:
ns-140	How dare you swear in front of my son?
ns-140	Yes, she said that damn was a cuss.
ns-140	Me:
ns-140	Damn is not a cuss word.
ns-141	She left for another dude (a player), has strung me along this whole time pretty much and been hot and cold.
ns-141	Now she’s on to another guy as of the end of March and is currently on vacation with him for 9 days in another state.
ns-141	However, she takes the same bike trail as me (the only one) for the past few months and we run into each other every couple weeks and have small talk.
ns-141	About a week and a half ago, we talked for well over an hour on the trail.
ns-141	Kind of disrespectful to the new boyfriend, huh?
ns-141	We get along and she told me happy birthday on May 3rd.
ns-141	However, I will not be wishing her one today.
ns-141	Birthdays are a big deal to her, but I can’t think of a reason why I should…
ns-142	After going “uh no?”, she sends me a picture of said candle holder from her kitchen.
ns-142	I of course go “what the fuck, you’re home?”, and it turns out she left an hour ago from the hospital.
ns-142	No updates.
ns-142	No phonecall.
ns-142	So I’m beyond pissed that I was even concerned for three days.
ns-142	TLDR: sickly narcisstic mom went into hospital for 3 days.
ns-142	I find out she’s home because of a candle holder.
ns-143	It’s been a few years and I don’t care to look back so long as we can be happy together, but it’s really hard for her.
ns-143	The thing that hurts her the most is that I let her go through my phone after finding the nudes and there was a message I sent to someone on Facebook in response to her calling me beautiful because of a song I made that I was sharing.
ns-143	I was very flirtatious, maybe more so than I was with my girlfriend when I was first talking to her, and that has been echoing in my girlfriend’s mind.
ns-143	It’s been extremely difficult for her.
ns-143	We have two dogs now.
ns-143	I was hoping us having two puppies to love would help draw her back to being in love with me again, because we have them to bond over, but she still can’t say “I love you too”.
ns-143	She doesn’t accept when I try to give her compliments, because I’ve said rude things in the past when I used to drink (2 years ago).
ns-144	You can try fancy elaborate games, but if you stink and dress like shit, best of luck to you, but I don’t see it happening.
ns-144	Working as a waiter has definitely forced me to up my grooming by trimming my nails, wearing Versace Crystal Noir and other fragrances etc., which I believe is the reason why most girls, even if they’re taken, at least are willing to have a conversation with me.
ns-144	Rejection is the ultimate tool for self-development, and even though I’ve been shot down by countless numbers of women in my life, I never let it get me down and I’m so proud of myself for even having the confidence to speak to these women, even though I may not have Hollywood good looks or charisma like Will Smith xD.
ns-144	You guys are all beautiful and I wish you all the best of success with finding your companions :-)
ns-145	She’s 18 inches long and weighs 56 grams at 15 months.
ns-145	I’m just curious if this is a pretty average growth rate for females or is she growing really fast?
ns-145	She eats like an absolute champion every 4-5 days and she’s already longer than some males get, so I’m curious!
ns-146	The anime is about a main character that’s in a game, but she doesn’t realise it, but the system says she’s dead and etc.
ns-146	I would like to watch the rest of it, so please help me.
ns-147	Looking for an anime.
ns-148	I don’t know if to others it’s strange, but to me it was.
ns-148	I got Covid by kissing another guy for the first time, so I had to tell my mum.
ns-148	I could’ve just lied and said it was because of sharing cups or kissing a girl, since I’m bi-sexual, but I knew my parents would be accepting...
ns-148	So I told them as it was.
ns-148	My mum was very disappointed, because she thought she knew me well, and though I told her everything, but now she couldn’t trust me anymore, because blah blah blah…
ns-148	Basically, he was very disappointed in me, and actually took time to convince her that I didn’t feel like telling her, because it’s private to me... until today.
ns-148	She doesn’t really trust me like before, but she’s ok, lol.
ns-149	Today it’s my birthday, so I’m sharing my “strange” coming out story.
ns-150	So me and my friend started playing Valorant again and want us to learn communications such as heaven and all of that.
ns-150	Now I know what heaven is, but I don’t know others, and if there is a website I would be happy to have to look at it :D
ns-150	(If you’re still confused, I’ll give a scenario: “I hit the Jett, she’s in heaven”, like the location.
ns-151	She’s an awesome cook, does all the grocery shopping.
ns-151	My aunt and I will be helping out too, but she’s not a good cook either, lol.
ns-151	So I want to make their lives easier by meal prepping, and to make sure my mom is eating well.
ns-151	She can’t be eating junk recovering!
ns-152	(I got this a lot where a girl gets hired and I have to help them, they are always rude to me for no reason, unless the woman is older or it’s a guy)
ns-152	She’s all nice and sweet to everyone else, but she’s just rude to me.
ns-152	She will take credit from me and blame me when stuff goes wrong (not to my face).
ns-152	The moment she is around guys and other people, she belittles me.
ns-152	She talks good about herself, takes my credit then blames me when something goes wrong and everyone in my department goes along with it., which is wrong.
ns-152	When she is there, she doesn’t do any work and clowns around with the guys but only when the managers aren’t there.
ns-152	The worst part about it is that people really like her and think me and her are close friends.
ns-153	The “false advertising” on the A4 passive is very easy to understand if you just read the whole skill, where it says multiple buffs can’t co-exist.
ns-153	Maybe I’m the only one, but I think this is all dumb and also kills a lot of people’s excitement.
ns-153	I don’t like to hear people freaking out for no reason over a five star, lol.
ns-153	It’s just like Zhongli.
ns-153	He was fine, but everyone freaked, because he wasn’t doing enough to dumpster content and was balanced.
ns-154	I’ve seen lots of people in the fandom make rude or racist comments about Liberty and it’s disgusting.
ns-154	Please leave her alone.
ns-154	And you do realize she’s black?
ns-154	Stop making fun of the actors’ ethnic features.
ns-154	It’s honestly rude and not cute.
ns-154	There is nothing wrong with her lips or having big lips in general.
ns-154	It’s not even funny.
ns-154	Honestly, it’s just sick and not cool to behave like that.
ns-154	And it’s not even just Liberty.
ns-154	I’ve seen people talk about Sav and also Jimmy’s hair.
ns-154	(Also moderators, please don’t take this down.
ns-154	I really want people to see it, and I have done nothing wrong.
ns-154	I’ve been having some of my posts randomly deleted for no reason)
ns-155	(As simple as removing the salad and remaking it without guacamole.)
ns-155	She then told me we gave her less meat, when I brought back the same plate without guacamole.
ns-156	She’s home for the first time!
ns-157	She’s finally back!
ns-158	I am making this because of one reason only.
ns-158	I have to keep my puppy in her crate at night, because if I don’t she will poop on the floor.
ns-158	So there’s already 6-8 hours of her being inactive.
ns-158	Then I have work, which is again 6-8 hours.
ns-158	I have to keep my Corgi in my bathroom at this time, because if I don’t, she will reek havoc unsupervised.
ns-159	Am I the asshole for starting a fight with an old friend (strong swearing)?
ns-160	So me and my crush were on a group chat on Snapchat with my friend.
ns-160	Me and my friend were arguing as a “joke” and then she said she preferred older guys, and my friend was (M14), and I said I’m a year older than you, and she says “what I mean by older guys, I mean aged 17” and it hurt my heart.
ns-160	TLDR: My crush says she prefers dudes who are 17 years old and I’m 16 and she’s 15 and it broke me down.
ns-161	Hello I am new on here, but I don’t know if I am the butthole or entitled one this story.
ns-161	This is short, but I was expecting to get a tattoo for my 18th birthday like any 18-year-old, but I wanted to go to this one shop that my brother goes to.
ns-161	I sent a direct message to the artist I wanted, but nothing for 2 months.
ns-161	Like yeah, I understand they are booked for summer tattoos, but at least say “Hey I am booked for the rest of ____”.
ns-161	But I was like “ok, well I am going to look at another artist’s work from this shop that does small tattoos.”
ns-161	Same thing happens: no answer.
ns-161	So me and my brother decide “ok, let’s go to the shop and ask, then we will at least get a answer”.
ns-161	We go, and this young girl attends to us.
ns-161	Let’s call her Brenda.
ns-161	I told her everything.
ns-161	Brenda said “well you can do the tattoo with me”.
ns-161	I said “I’ll be back.
ns-161	I’ll think about it”.
ns-161	I got back in the car and scrolled through her work.
ns-161	It was good work, so I went back and told her “yeah let’s do this”.
ns-161	I signed everything.
ns-161	She didn’t even ask for ID, which I found weird, because I had gotten my piercings done by the same shop and they needed to have ID on records and so on.
ns-161	I brushed it off, since she’s new and all.
ns-161	She worked on me for an hour, told me all the necessary tattoo care stuff and said after 3 or 4 weeks to let her know if there need to be fixes and that it was on her.
ns-161	I was like “ok, great, thanks!”
ns-161	4 weeks passed and there were a lot of mistakes made, because I got a small tattoo heartbeat with a “;” in the middle, but the period on top was a small heart.
ns-161	The right side of the heart was smaller then the other side, and some of the lines were thick to thin then broke to thick again.
ns-162	So I reset it, and yeah oops, I was doing it wrong all this time.
ns-162	Did anyone else kick it away and get mad it wasn’t dying?
ns-163	Then afterwards she began to text very dry, and like through text she kind of sounded mad.
ns-163	I texted her in the night yesterday asking if she’s mad, and like she said she’s only a bit let down.
ns-163	I was really confused afterwards as she began to drag text me, and like I apologized to her and she said its alright.
ns-163	Then I just told her I’m going to sleep, and she just left my message on delivered and, like, she didn’t reply until today.
ns-164	How to tell whether she’s mad at me or just annoyed, because right now I’m really confused?
ns-165	Would I be the asshole if I was just a bigger sarcastic asshole to another asshole?
ns-166	Her tumors are beginning to open through her skin, she won’t jump, painkillers don’t help, she ate a lot yesterday but won’t eat or drink today, she hid most the day, but... it’s hard, because she’s alert.
ns-166	It feels wrong, because she looks at me like “I love you.
ns-166	I’m happy you’re here with me.”
ns-166	But the vet said she wasn’t even supposed to live this long, and the tumors will only get worse, and even if we had done chemotherapy, it would have only prolonged it.
ns-167	My friend told my girlfriend something.
ns-167	She then broke up with me.
ns-167	I don’t know what to do now, because she and the ex-friend were the only people that I had.
ns-167	What should I do to try and regain my relationship, because she’s helped me through a lot over our 2 years of dating?
ns-167	TLDR: My girlfriend broke up with me because of something someone said, and I want to regain my relationship with my girlfriend.
ns-168	He waited for me to leave to fire someone who has been a dedicated employee, because she’s a person of color with tattoos and “fits the part” of someone he considered would be on drugs.
ns-168	It makes me sick.
ns-168	I reported all this high up, because I need to protect my staff, but I’m worried that this will turn around and bite me.
ns-169	My ex loves kids.
ns-169	She was playing Captain Save a Hoe, almost caught a domestic case over this woman’s situation with this girl’s “crazy” baby daddy.
ns-169	They moved fast.
ns-169	They were in each other’s life.
ns-169	It hasn’t even been two months!
ns-169	I’m so hurt.
ns-169	She never wanted to build a life with me.
ns-169	I knew she would be all in if I had a kid on me.
ns-170	They’ve grown out to the point they look kind of awkward, and she’s saying I should get them filled, but would it be weird or bad (like for my nails) or anything to ask about getting them completely redone with something I’d like better?
ns-171	Aah!
ns-171	She said she might have some clothes that fit me.
ns-171	I’m dying!
ns-171	She’s so supportive and nice, oh my God!
ns-172	So, it’s 0:34 the first of January while posting this, and my sister (F14) just ruined my New Year by calling my mum fat and telling her she’s a drinker when she poured herself a glass of champagne, which she only does on her birthday on Christmas Eve and on New year.
ns-172	Now my parents are pissed off, my grandparents are pissed off, and my sister thinks she was funny.
ns-172	The same thing happened on Christmas Eve, and now the whole feeling of New Year is gone and I hate my sister.
ns-172	P.S. English is my second language so sorry for my spelling.
ns-173	Screw INTJ’s. Why have they got to be good at everything?
ns-174	It was a mistake getting the booster the day before New Year’s.
ns-174	I feel like absolute dog water.
ns-175	Literally most of today we spent cuddling and talking about random shit and I almost cried 🙏 I’m so happy, bro.
ns-175	She’s so cool.
ns-175	I’m going to ask her to be my girlfriend at midnight :-)
ns-175	Also, happy New Year’s Eve and happy New Year everyone!
ns-176	First of all, the satisfaction I get from saying I am the manager when customers ask for one is amazing.
ns-176	A high I’ll never come off of.
ns-176	Second of all, a customer comes in for the second time, mad because I didn’t do copies from a book because of copyright.
ns-176	She goes “well, I called customer service and they said you were not supposed to reject me like that”.
ns-176	And I’m like ??, ma’am it’s in our policy.
ns-176	I don’t care what customer service says.
ns-176	She keeps on being rude and yapping then throws the book on the counter and goes “make my copy”.
ns-176	Like, lol, not when you act rude like that.
ns-177	Our cat is getting fixed on the 11th, and she’s such a cuddly, loving, little girl and I love her cuddles every night and in the morning.
ns-177	I’m just scared that she isn’t going to be like that after she gets fixed.
ns-177	Am I overthinking it?
ns-177	Do you think since she’s in the habit now and loves cuddles and such she’ll do it all her life?
ns-178	Me and my partner have this running joke that I don’t fart.
ns-178	It started out as a joke after I told her that as an answer to a truth or dare question on our first date.
ns-178	Recently she’s been asking me if I’ll fart in front of her.
ns-178	She says her friends have all heard their partners fart and it’s weird she’s never heard me do it.
ns-179	I can’t believe she saying I’m depressed looking while she’s such a shy girl and weird thinking she’s not.
ns-179	So delusional.
ns-179	I hate it, but they are my only friends.
ns-179	She’s calling me cringe without a reason...
ns-180	My friends are mean and delusional.
ns-180	One is immature and shy and always pulling me down.
ns-180	The other is fine, just jealous, and it’s getting on my nerves.
ns-180	What to do?
ns-181	This is a setup I can live with.
ns-181	My boyfriend’s and my fear however is that in a few years when we’re ready to settle down, Gina will be wanting to move in and be long term with her own boyfriend.
ns-181	I’m very stuck.
ns-181	I love my boyfriend and desperately want to keep his system happy.
ns-181	But I am not going to allow any more pushing of the boundaries.
ns-181	What do I do here?
ns-182	Boundary Issues with my boyfriend’s alter.
ns-183	She was super keen for a second date and we arranged a location but not a date, due to the Christmas holidays.
ns-183	I appreciate it’s a busy period for people, so our responses were like 1 per day.
ns-183	She was up-front when we met and said she’s shit at texting, and has apologised when we were speaking for slow replies, something to which I said “don’t worry, I know you’re busy!”
ns-183	The conversation seems to flow well, lots of questions from her side in the conversation.
ns-183	However, I’ve not received a response for 3 days (unread), but she’s viewed my story and posted a story since.
ns-183	It was New Year’s Eve.
ns-184	So I was all ready for the New Year actually thinking positive and the changes I’m going to make, etc.
ns-184	Then I see he’s posted a picture of them both that she’s taken saying “love of my life”.
ns-184	It destroyed me.
ns-184	He also put a status about 2022 being a special one.
ns-184	Talk about rubbing it in my face!
ns-185	Ex’s boyfriend posted a picture of them :-(
ns-186	Every time I ask other people for advice on this situation, they all tell me that she’s probably insecure and looks up to me (even though she’s older, what the fuck?) and that I shouldn’t blame her for the way she feels.
ns-186	I cannot deal with her.
ns-186	She drains the life out of me.
ns-186	I cannot talk about anything without her either trying to copy me or compete with me.
ns-186	Recently I’ve been losing weight, and our family members noticed and commented on it.
ns-186	In the corner of my eye, I could see her getting uncomfortable and then obviously she brought herself up and started talking about her accomplishments.
ns-187	We agree to separate as our marriage was hitting a nose dive in general.
ns-187	2 months later, we get back together.
ns-187	We do intensive therapy and things seem to be great.
ns-187	I’m so happy.
ns-187	In our anniversary month, what do I see on his phone Snapchat?
ns-187	I look at it again, I see Jane, but this time I can look at their conversation history throughout this whole year and last.
ns-188	So I just got my first bearded dragon.
ns-188	He’s only a month old, and like most new owners, I’m worried about if he or she is not eating enough.
ns-188	I try to feed him in periods throughout the day, but so far I’ve only been able to feed him about 6-7 crickets.
ns-188	I’ve tried feeding him some vegetables too, but the guy doesn’t show any interest in them.
ns-188	Is there anything I’m doing wrong or is he just fine and I’m overly worried?
ns-189	Then I found out about this really cool website called Complex.
ns-189	They’re sort of like journalism but better, since they’re all about hip hop.
ns-189	I found out about Travis Scott through Complex.
ns-189	Before, I listened to trash artists with no aesthetic, but Travis Scott made me realize that aesthetic is really important.
ns-189	Now I like Tame Impala, and I’ve started dressing weirder, I bought my first pair of joggers last week and hopefully I’ll wear them soon.
ns-190	Is it just me cringing at the Twitter posts by Albatross?
ns-190	Everyone who knows who he is knows his stance.
ns-190	He’s making it seem like XVG is a sinking ship at the moment, and it’s doing fine.
ns-191	So I have this friend in real life.
ns-191	Man, the dude is known everywhere.
ns-191	He’s got a solid reputation on the streets, in the jails.
ns-191	Everywhere this guy goes, everyone knows him.
ns-191	He was trying to explain to me how to get more karma on Reddit, because I feel like I’m not really known.
ns-192	How do you get hella karma?
ns-193	I’m 21, he’s about to be 23.
ns-193	My issue is that he seems to have no ambition anymore.
ns-193	He doesn’t work and doesn’t make an effort to finish school, even small trade schools for a certification as an EMT.
ns-193	He failed it the first time by 2 points, and I think he fears failure so he doesn’t really want to try anything anymore.
ns-193	He’s been unemployed for over a year now and failed that school almost a year ago.
ns-194	I’ve gotten Super Smough about 5 times, but I always get stuck in his nuclear butt bomb aura.
ns-194	I swear I’m far enough away, but it still shocks me in 1 hit.
ns-194	I’m using a 2H battle axe +10 gargoyle helms and naked (even with tattered armor it doesn’t seem to make a difference) Chloranthy ring and ring of steel protection.
ns-194	Any tips?
ns-194	I know by throwing myself at them enough times I’ll get them, but it’s slowly wearing at my sanity.
ns-194	I know what to do, but I seem to always get caught in a dumb combination or something.
ns-195	I bet you didn’t bother reading the whole number, or notice the letter I put in there, and now you’ll go back to check only to realize there was no letter.
ns-195	What I if also told you you read this sentence wrong too?
ns-195	Well, now that I have your attention!
ns-195	I hope you’ll carefully read through the rest of this post :-)
ns-196	19/F Aw shit, here we go again for the 7754378435116th time.
ns-197	If I just want to make Draven my 1 carry, how should I do it?
ns-197	I know he’s a good unit, but what items can turn him into a god?
ns-197	I tried healing sword and rapid fire cannon, but I get lost after that.
ns-198	Atlus is a great character.
ns-198	However, his shield’s gun is overpowered and his rewind ability is somewhat annoying.
ns-198	However the most annoying thing is his shield.
ns-198	If you place down the shield and just use it to stop bullets that’s fine.
ns-198	However I was playing as Skye today and threw my ult at his shield.
ns-198	It did not activate, because it got absorbed.
ns-198	I don’t know about other players’ opinions, but I believe that Atlus should be nerfed a good bit so he’s not overpowered enough to counter everything.
ns-198	Tell me what you people think.
ns-199	I didn’t think anything of it, so when I went to give the last cookies on the shelf to him, the entitled kid started screaming “Mommy, he stole my cookies!”
ns-199	At first I was startled.
ns-199	I started to get nervous, and I froze.
ns-199	Then entitled parent walks up and starts yelling “Give those cookies back to my daughter!
ns-199	Give them back!”
ns-199	And I did not know what to say at first, but then something came to mind: just say “but I didn’t.”
ns-199	But the way I said it was so cautious.
ns-199	Then my sister takes the cookies from my hands and handed them to my dad.
ns-199	That’s when my dad noticed (he’s old — sad he didn’t realise a little bit earlier) He called a manager to the scene, and the manager told us to continue and he’ll deal with it.
ns-200	We broke up 2 months ago.
ns-200	We had very little contact.
ns-200	But tomorrow I’m no longer putting up with it.
ns-200	He would be the one to reach out all the time.
ns-200	I never reached out first.
ns-200	And if I answered, it was only about the class he was paying me to do.
ns-200	He is still on my car insurance, and he messaged me on Friend asking what was going on with it.
ns-200	I answered the next day and said I didn’t change anything.
ns-200	After that part of the conversation ended, I asked him how he was doing about the death of his dog.
ns-200	(He is deployed and his dog was his world)
ns-200	He said that he’s good when he doesn’t think about it and how he told his mom to cremate him, etc.
ns-201	Day 1 of no contact starts tomorrow.
ns-201	Help.
ns-202	So me and a friend ended up making a poster.
ns-202	We used my name and I’ll credit his Instagram below.
ns-202	He’s a good guy.
ns-202	I’m glad we got both our ideas in the poster for the game and our story.
ns-202	Would you guys like either homemade lore or not?
ns-202	I couldn’t post this on the Fallout Reddit for some reason.
ns-202	It wouldn’t let me put the photo.
ns-202	I hope it’s good, guys!
ns-203	Is it even possible for ITSOKTOCRY to blow up outside of the 3 songs he’s had do extremely well? Like get burst into the mainstream rather than just have a few albums do well then fall off?
ns-204	Me and my friend have been playing Minecraft together for a while, and they made their own server so we can play on it together alone, cool.
ns-204	I have always told my friend how much I despise griefers, because they don’t just destroy something in a game, they destroy hours of work, and it fucking sucks.
ns-204	My friend lately has been really mean to me when we are playing, constantly saying I’m mean if I don’t go half way across the map to give him material that can be easily obtained where he is, literally repeating to me non-stop how I’m “mean” or a “bad person”, because I’m busy doing something so I can’t go give him his shit.
ns-205	Well, I finally get a chance to let loose and have a wine date with a childhood friend of mine that I don’t see often at all.
ns-205	We drink (at my house) while the kids are playing and such.
ns-205	Nothing heavy.
ns-205	We do get slightly tipsy, you know.
ns-205	Towards the end, my husband sends me a Facebook message saying he’s ready for her to leave (she’d been there 2 hours at this point) and then he starts passive-aggressive cleaning in front of us.
ns-206	He’s going through a divorce so he keeps telling me that’s taking all his money.
ns-206	I didn’t give him a title as I didn’t even get one when I bought it.
ns-206	It was salvaged from some guys at a used car lot.
ns-206	They gave me a bill of sale, but I’ve long since lost it.
ns-206	Should take him to court or do you think it’s not worth it?
ns-206	Also, if I did want to how, would I?
ns-207	So I just told this guy in my class, who was also weird as fuck and gave it to him saying “oof, I sat on it.
ns-207	It broke.
ns-207	Do you just want it?”
ns-207	He’s like “no, ew”.
ns-207	I have OCD and immediately got ashamed and was like “lol, why’s it gross?
ns-207	It’s the same as a whole one (and along that line), like, lol, why?”, and he was like “ok, oof, it’s not” and I’m like “lol, why did you say that?”
ns-207	I was saying it jokingly, but I’m afraid I looked weird.
ns-207	Like what the fuck?
ns-207	Why’s she upset or playfully upset that I don’t want it.
ns-208	My human staff comes home tasting of sausages and cheese.
ns-208	I think she has another fluff she is making treats for.
ns-208	Should I be sad or angry?
ns-208	What does your human taste of when they come home?
ns-209	I can tell where your human has been and what they do by taste when they come back?
ns-210	Hey guys, I just wanted to share this helpful application with you all :-D.
ns-210	It’s not that I am trying to promote this application or something.
ns-210	It really helped me a lot.
ns-210	That’s why I thought it might even help you guys out.
ns-210	I’ve seen quite a lot of people struggling to increase their team OVRs, and many are thinking to buy players, but can’t decide which will boost their team OVRs the most.
ns-210	This application helps to calculate the OVR of your team after filling all the players in their respective positions.
ns-210	It is really tough for most people (F2P players) to keep on buying and selling players to decide our team OVR since it will result in a huge loss of coins (because of 10% EA tax).
ns-211	What’s the recommended amount of dedicated RAM I should have to server?
ns-212	If you are reading this, you should be ashamed of yourself.
ns-212	You should be asleep.
ns-212	Go to bed, I say.
ns-213	Once upon a time, there was a girl named Star Butterfly.
ns-213	She had blond hair, blue eyes and a super cute and colorful dress.
ns-213	And she had a magic wand!
ns-213	One day she got kicked out of Mewny (her home dimension) by her mean mom >:-( just because she made a mistake.
ns-213	So she had to go to Earth.
ns-213	On Earth, there was a boy named Marco Diaz.
ns-213	He liked safety and he was super handsome.
ns-213	Everybody at school was in love with him!
ns-213	(Except for that idiot Jackie)
ns-213	So anyway, Star came to the principal’s office.
ns-213	He was like “Star, this is Marco.
ns-213	He’s your guide.”
ns-213	Star looked at Marco and she was shocked.
ns-213	“Wow, you’re so hot.”
ns-213	“lol, thank you” he said, blushing, and he winked.
ns-213	“Let me show you around the school.”
ns-213	“Ok”, said Star.
ns-213	So they walked around school and they became friends.
ns-213	“Ok, since you’re my best friend now, I should probably tell you who I am”, said Star.
ns-213	“I’m a magic princess”.
ns-213	Then she took out her wand and created 667 laser puppies!
ns-214	I have a question for this Reddit.
ns-214	Can you provide honest answers?
ns-214	I currently have a custom build PC with i7 3770k 32g@1666 RAM and single GTX 1080 GPU.
ns-214	Should I get a second one for 650 euros or wait for what upcoming years will bring?
ns-215	GTX 1080 SLI or save money for 11th generation Nvidia xx80 TI GPU?
ns-216	I know a lot about Jailbreak.
ns-216	Should I make a Jailbreak?
ns-217	How many likes can a thoughtless post get as long as I like Telecaster? :l.
ns-217	If you don’t upvote post you hate Telecasters and should die.
ns-217	Thanks, ok.
ns-218	I love Telecasters.
ns-219	We should rename August to October, because he wasn’t released in August.
ns-220	I bought GTA4 for Steam PC and it won’t work.
ns-220	It worked fine for a small year on Windows 7, and now my PC has Windows 10 and it won’t work.
ns-220	I made Social Club and Games for Windows Live accounts, but it won’t work even with accounts.
ns-220	It won’t work even for single player.
ns-220	It won’t work after the people on screen wait in the loading screen.
ns-220	Then suddenly when the game should start, it just closes the window and that’s it.
ns-220	So how make it work ?
ns-221	How do we get them to know they should use it?
ns-221	The only feasible situation I see is a complete and big economic collapse...
ns-221	I want to use it, because I want to control my own destiny and not be robbed by the central banks or the government and I want to feel my own liberty.
ns-221	I do not have even $1 in my bank account, because I don’t want to own debt tokens.
ns-221	I want to own freedom...
ns-221	How do we change the landscape?
ns-221	What are your thoughts?
ns-221	Sorry for my English being bad.
ns-222	I should buy up that limited time bike for Halloween before it disappears next week.
ns-223	Inside your body, deep beneath your skin, muscles, and not beneath your organs, lurks 1 (one) skeleton.
ns-223	Spooky!
ns-223	But wait, it gets worse.
ns-223	The skeleton inside you doesn’t even pay rent!
ns-223	He/she lives in your body so he/she should pay rent!
ns-223	They freeload off you and don’t even do shit for you.
ns-223	So you should evict your spooky boy.
ns-223	Happy Halloween!
ns-223	Edit: I didn’t expect this post to blow up like it has!
ns-223	Thanks for the 6 upvotes!
ns-224	Just small information, I’m 5’9 140lbs male.
ns-224	Currently, my 5k is 1:58.7 and my 2k is a 1:51.1
ns-224	My coach says I should be 1:49 for a 2k, but I really can’t hold a 1:49 for more than 1200 meters before my split just rises to 2:05-2:10.
ns-224	Is 1:49 just my coach being a typical “you should be good, but you’re not, so I’m going to give you unrealistic goals”, or should I be at 1:49?
ns-225	My head hurts when I go krumping heads with other boys!
ns-225	Green lighting things go all over the place too!
ns-225	What should I do, doctors?!
ns-226	Right, so I’ve fixed my headaches!
ns-226	I’ve had to throw up some burny green stuff!
ns-226	The boss says I should do that more on the battle, the place we’ve been fighting in!
ns-226	I’ve got a metal stick for my trouble too!
ns-227	This poem went as follows: > My name is frog, > I like to play, > Out in the rain, > All night and day.
ns-227	> My skin is green, > My face is coy, > You look and say, > Here comes that boy.
ns-227	This was received rather poorly, earning me some disapproving comments.
ns-228	Aren’t you all tired of seeing at least the first two jumping into battle and wiping out your whole team in an instant?
ns-228	I’ve heard somewhere about people saying that if they weren’t here then, well, the game would be balanced.
ns-228	Well, I beg to differ, because there’s Akai with his insane disruption and Diggie with his timely ult or maybe even Irithel might be banned because of her deadly ability to snowball and splash ult.
ns-228	Back to the topic.
ns-228	Honestly, the king and queen of this game are Lancelot and his beloved Fanny.
ns-229	You know, to keep it safe from me in little car where I can go anywhere.
ns-229	And then Mom-O decides to go to the gym to do a quick workout, whatever that is.
ns-229	She says to me, “You leave the steak alone, doggo.
ns-229	You be a good girl!”
ns-229	She tied a plastic bag real tight around the steak.
ns-229	Haha!
ns-229	Then she goes into the gym, and when she come back many forevers later, guess what?
ns-229	Haha!
ns-229	She opens the tiny car and looks at me and looks at the steak bag… and she says, “Good Girl!
ns-229	You left the steak alone!”
ns-229	And that is the story of me being a good girl.
ns-229	Mom-O says she should have brought the steak into the gym and left it on the bench next to her with her sweatshirt.
ns-229	She says she is dumb not to think of that.
ns-229	Maybe Mom-O will get smart in a few forevers.
ns-230	My bed smells like disease.
ns-230	I should probably wash it.
ns-231	Please send me some tips and stuff on what to teach him.
ns-231	Currently he’s doing pretty good, though the only thing he buys is shotguns, because that’s the only gun he gets kills from.
ns-231	I already taught him the basics like planting the spike and things like that.
ns-231	By the way, this is coming from an Iron 3 player (hardstuck, friends say I should be silver and some even say platinum, because I carried a gold player).
ns-232	Do you know how some motherfuckers exist?
ns-232	They literally get close to you, then all of a sudden you have problems, and even though you apologize again and again and again, no it’s never enough for them.
ns-232	I was in a Google Meet, but I told them I’d be back in 10.
ns-232	I forgot my phone so I went to get it, and guess what, them speaking about you and backstabbing you.
ns-232	You seriously don’t know what to do and whom to trust anymore.
ns-232	Maybe I am overthinking, but I’d rather die alone than live among these kind of people.
ns-232	Maybe I should just ignore them?
ns-232	Or should I give them another chance?
ns-232	Or maybe I am just weird, lol.
ns-233	l have developed feelings for my best friend.
ns-233	Now, the question is: should l tell her how l feel about her?
ns-233	Will this affect our relationship that we have?
ns-233	How will she take it?
ns-234	I’ve been waiting for two years now, savings from then and I barely made 200 USD until now.
ns-234	I’m still studying, and gaming is my dream… and these prices are giving me depression and hopelessness from life… to be honest…
ns-234	What should I get?
ns-234	A monitor or a GPU…?
ns-234	Some of you are so lucky to get a GPU for free on here… lol…
ns-235	Am I the asshole?
ns-235	Me (31F) asked my kids dad (43M) to help me finish off stripping wallpaper in the kids’ room so I can finish decorating it.
ns-235	I recently had surgery and am not meant to lift too much or stretch but felt OK and thought I could do it alone.
ns-235	I can’t.
ns-235	I hurt my incisions so asked him to help do the top of the walls where I can’t reach.
ns-235	He said yes and today came to do it.
ns-235	After a bit, he said he was done and leaving.
ns-235	I gave him £20 and said how grateful I am for the help.
ns-235	I checked the room once he left...
ns-235	Both kids’ beds were full of torn off wallpaper, drawers cracked where he stood on them.
ns-235	I’ve still 2 walls left unfinished and have spent the last 45 minutes picking up wallpaper from everything.
ns-235	His kids sleep on these beds.
ns-235	Am I the asshole if I confront him about the mess or should I let it go and not bother asking in future?
ns-236	My boyfriend gets impatient easily and gets annoyed when I ask dumb questions (for example, I didn’t know how to fill my tire and he got annoyed after he explained it once and then said “why is it hard?
ns-236	Just fill it”.
ns-236	So I tried to do it but I failed.
ns-236	Later he was like “babe… it took you an hour to fill your tire?”
ns-236	Then when I do it myself and don’t ask him he goes “why don’t you ask me?
ns-236	I can teach you or help you”, but I refrain from asking, because he gets frustrated.
ns-237	The last couple of calls had arguments, as he got mad, because I beat his ass in video games (even though gaming is his only hobby) and I’ve left wondering if our relationship is worth the trouble.
ns-237	I’ve talked about him to lots of my real life friends, and they all ask why I continue to be his friend, and I can never confidently answer why.
ns-237	But he’s depressed and lonely and wants my attention as I’m one of the only people who actively tries to interact with him online.
ns-238	Yeah I know, my shoes don’t match.
ns-238	They match the graffiti though!
ns-238	I’m trying a lot of different styles, so let me know what I should change.
ns-238	Hat: Sicko by Ian Conner
ns-238	Shoes: Nike Everything else is thrifted.
ns-239	Ok, so I swallowed a small piece of box (?) tape as I was trying to bite it off with my teeth, and then I feel it in my ear 😭 not ear but that hole in my throat that leads to the ear.
ns-239	It’s just stuck there, oh my God 😭😭😭 What should I do, lol?
ns-240	She had me live with a woman once named Chi who said similar stuff, and … it’s just dude what…?
ns-240	Heck, it’s weird.
ns-240	So maybe it’s both a sort of a paradox (life is), but I just want to know, honestly, did anyone else feel it?
ns-240	I want a logical explanation please, and if one doesn’t exist, well I mean, because long before…
ns-240	I was “of age” so to speak… for lack of more efficient words that would be appropriate, because I don’t drink, but I’ve…hmm…
ns-240	I’m an adult, let’s put it like that.
ns-240	There’s other stuff out there, but long before that, me and my family saw a UFO.
ns-240	Even my stepdad said he couldn’t think of what else it could’ve been, and me and my friends saw this white hooded thing in a park about 10 feet tall and, like… it doesn’t really scare me, because I think it’s the way life is.
ns-240	Things change.
ns-240	They don’t always have to make sense, and others say that too.
ns-241	Here is an example of two paragraphs written in the alternate spelling system and then in regular spelling: > The North Wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stronger, when a traveller came along wrapped in a warm cloak.
ns-241	They agreed that the one who first succeeded in making the traveller take his cloak off should be considered stronger than the other.
ns-241	Then the North Wind blew as hard as he could, but the more he blew the more closely did the traveller fold his cloak around him; and at last the North Wind gave up the attempt.
ns-241	Then the Sun shined out warmly, and immediately the traveller took off his cloak.
ns-241	And so the North Wind was obliged to confer that the Sun was the stronger of the two.
ns-241	> That quick beige fox jumped in the air over each thin dog under a calm autumn moon.
ns-241	Look out, I shout, for he’s foiled you yet again, creating chaos.
ns-242	Who would win?
ns-242	Please give a detailed explanation.
ns-243	Ares (Greek mythology) vs. Mars (Roman mythology) vs. Svetovid (Slavic mythology) vs. Odin (Norse mythology) vs. The Big Bang (Atheistic mythology).
ns-244	I am very ready.
ns-244	I am very good.
ns-245	I would like to apply for village idiot.
ns-246	Should I get Horizon Zero Dawn or ELEX, because they are the same price right now, so what should I buy?
ns-246	I’m just looking for reason.
ns-246	By the way, I like open world a lot and shooters, e.g. Skyrim, Battlefield, COD, Ark Survival Evolved.
ns-246	So any ideas on what I should be?
ns-246	By the way, I would prefer them really quick.
ns-246	Thanks in advance.
ns-247	Thanks for the suggestions guys.
ns-247	We are going to try to get the AK-477, because someone said it would help, but where do we find it?!
ns-247	Please help with it.
ns-247	We can’t do it alone :-)
ns-248	I reside in Hyderabad, India, currently pursuing my Bachelor’s in computer science.
ns-248	I am a Canadian citizen, but for enrolment it is required to appear for the IELTS exam.
ns-248	Now, the doubt that has arisen is… would my admission be considered international or domestic?
ns-248	On a side note, how hard is it to be admitted to UoT’s computer science program?
ns-248	What would a typical admitted applicant have to get admitted?
ns-249	I would prefer a hardcore clan with a plan.
ns-249	With a strict mentality of how certain things would go down.
ns-249	I mean a clan that always has a goal or target, that also enjoy teamplay.
ns-249	It’s not a necessity, but it would be nice.
ns-249	PM me if you’re interested!
ns-249	By the way, it’s my first post on this subreddit, so I might not have gotten it all down correct.
ns-250	I’ve literally heard people tell me they learnt then forgot the entire Japanese language through anime.
ns-250	I live in a house with a single mother whose first language is Thai and I barely heard English until I was like 4.
ns-250	She would speak in Thai to me yet I don’t know any Thai.
ns-250	You can’t learn Japanese though anime.
ns-250	In fact I watched anime in Thai dubbed as a child.
ns-250	I don’t fucking know shit.
ns-250	Fools thinking they are out here saying “konnichiwa” in style, I’m contacting the authorities.
ns-251	Here’s a question for you.
ns-251	So you know the Panzer, Blue Gitz, the Tau or whatever?
ns-251	So I, being a Mek, notice that they’ve got tanks and stuff that are flying, right, but they’ve not go the flames coming from whatever thrusters keep them in the air.
ns-251	And they don’t make the beautiful roar that thrusters make.
ns-251	I figure some commando would want a flying truck that doesn’t make a noise.
ns-251	It’s a good market strategy.
ns-251	Anyway, the question: “how do I krump gravity without a sound?”
ns-252	Construction: teleport to house, for when they work on making player-owned houses useful, this would be godly to have.
ns-252	Heck!
ns-252	Even now, player-owned houses has a permanent dummy for adrenaline building, prayer altar, and if they make it like Old School RuneScape, where you can teleport outside any player-owned house portal, this cape would be used a lot.
ns-252	Hitpoints: Heal from regeneration ability increased, current perk I doubt would be used at either bossing or slayer.
ns-252	This one is used at slayer at least.
ns-253	I got one of my annual minds.com token ads in my mail today (I of course unsubscribed as soon as I found the option) and thought “hey, what the heck, let’s make a visit on the supposedly “alternative Facebook” that I just recently got denied for having a “non-believable name” and waiting further ID specification before I can use it again.”
ns-253	And so I did and found out on the 2nd or 3rd post that The AJ Show has been blocked on YouTube, I’m not a fan of rightwing stuff and was actually the reason I stopped watching it 2 years ago, though the small fragrance of freedom was that hard to find among the 90% national-capitalism the site has to offer, but anyhow, I got the idea of a non-censoring video site like LiveLeak but much more simple and less “newsy” that anyone can post on.
ns-253	No content would be removed ❤️
ns-254	Hi guys.
ns-254	I’m at 1500 hours right now, and my instructor still doesn’t let me solo.
ns-254	I think I’m doing my manoeuvres ok, but the instructor says I still need more practice.
ns-254	I’ve tried my manoeuvres on a flight simulator, and my friend captain says that I should stop sending him videos of me playing GTA on my computer at 1 in the morning, although I trained hard on my flight manoeuvres.
ns-254	What should I do?
ns-254	I’m literally crying and shaking right now.
ns-254	My friend would never do that :-(
ns-255	Why don’t they make like Sesame Street for the kids, yo?
ns-255	Like, it is very educational, I think kids would learn a lot from it.
ns-256	I’m kind of hoping to find a place that doesn’t charge those exorbitant commission and all the extras.
ns-256	I have some questions and hope someone can help answer.
ns-256	1. I saw some ads on Shooroq... no commission, etc.
ns-256	Are there any hidden costs I need to be vary about?
ns-256	2. Is there enough parking for the second car?
ns-256	3. How much would the DEWA charges for a 1BHK come to?
ns-256	4. Any other areas I should look for in Dubai that has reasonable rent ?
ns-256	It’s a bit unnerving to manage expenses on 1 person’s salary in this place...
ns-256	I appreciate any advice I get.
ns-257	Bones says something like “switchblade on my waist don’t test”, and it was old young teenage bones, and the beat was hella mellow.
ns-257	I would really appreciate this.
ns-258	Finally it’s giving me an internet connection, but the only problem is, it’s so slow.
ns-258	It’s capable of loading like Google, but anything else just times out.
ns-258	And for some reason I can’t access my router admin page.
ns-258	Really weird.
ns-258	It’s just a white screen or it times out loading it, or the page becomes unresponsive!
ns-258	Help would be appreciated, thank you!
ns-259	Hey all, so today I was in the group chat with friends, and like four of them were roasting the fuck out of me, and at first it was funny, then my ego and self-respect got crippled after building it up for a couple days.
ns-259	Haha, fun.
ns-259	Yes, I know I am lonely and won’t get a girlfriend, but you don’t need to be jerk like that, haha.
ns-260	Hi there, it’s good to see you again!
ns-260	*sits down*
ns-260	How have you been?
ns-260	*cuts a potato with my sacrificial dagger*
ns-260	Wow, that’s great to hear.
ns-260	*adds 12kg of salt*
ns-260	Hm, there we go.
ns-260	*throws a handful over my left shoulder for the devil*
ns-260	Ok good, let’s eat.
ns-260	*removes a small flask from my jacket and pours blood from it onto my plate in a small thick puddle*
ns-260	Haha, that’s the good stuff right there.
ns-260	*chomp chomp
ns-260	*
ns-260	Do you want some?
ns-260	No?
ns-260	Ok good *eats a spoonful of salt*
ns-260	Oh!
ns-260	This is crunchy.
ns-260	*chews and spits out bones*
ns-260	Huh *licks lips*
ns-260	Welp, that was wonderful, I’m pooped.
ns-260	*gets up*
ns-260	Thanks for having me over!
ns-260	*transforms into a bat and flies away*
ns-261	I’m feeling sad, but it’s okay I guess.
ns-261	Because medicines will help help us all.
ns-261	Thank you, have a good morning and good night and good evening Truman show, haha.
ns-262	Just kidding.
ns-262	It’s going to be just as shitty if not worse than last year.
ns-263	All these skin mods and such, how’s it being done?
ns-263	I’d like to try it.
ns-263	Is it player-side only?
ns-264	Mods?
ns-264	How are people modding Battlefront 2 or is it Photoshop?
ns-265	Hi, I was wondering whether or not it is worth dropping some money on pets.
ns-265	Like, I saw how much some people can spend on them to get good results (like T4), and I wouldn’t want to spend that much :-D.
ns-265	Currently, I have 5 T1 pets, and I wouldn’t mind seeing some increase in their looting speed, but I wonder if dropping “just” $100 would be worth it.
ns-266	Is it worth dropping $100 on pets?
ns-267	Towards the end of senior year and that summer, I don’t know what happened, but I got a hot body and my face was all “girl, you’ve been through some shit.
ns-267	Have a gift”, so now I’m pretty.
ns-267	I just made a post on a different subreddit about having a nice date today, which is nice, but I am very hesitant on making friends and stuff because of the last two years.
ns-267	So like, after my glow up or whatever, more people started talking to me, yeah.
ns-267	And a lot of boys did too!
ns-267	I never really had very many friends, so this was a huge yay!
ns-267	The first boy I hung out with was really nice, but then we got high and I did very regrettable things I do not like.
ns-267	Well, that boy was super happy and told lots of boys.
ns-268	I don’t want to jinx it and call them out by name, but I’m talking with a company and I’m hoping it works out!
ns-268	I’m excited about all things I’ll be able to do with these free promo products to help other people and possibly get them off some or all of their Rx drugs!
ns-268	I’m excited for myself, because I have a bunch of medical issues that I do not use Rx drugs for and the other stuff I buy is expensive.
ns-268	This sponsorship will help me, it will help me help others, and it will help this company as well.
ns-268	I’m ready, I’m ready!
ns-269	I’m hella excited! I might be picking up a new sponsor!
ns-270	I will be posting more here once I get… comfortable again.
ns-270	(Self-love is important!)
ns-270	I’m on and off though, and have quite a bit of messages to go through - will get to them when I can :-)
ns-270	In the meantime, Happy New Year!
ns-270	P.S. I don’t have a Snapchat and don’t take any money, I just like to show off, you know, closet slut things :-)
ns-270	lol
ns-270	Talk to you later, everyone!
ns-271	He said “shh, just kiss me you fool”.
ns-271	I still love him and I cried so much on Valentine’s weekend (don’t judge, lmao), but I said “No.
ns-271	You’re fucked up now.
ns-271	What’s going on?”
ns-271	He never replied to me afterwards, and this interaction took about 10 minutes through text.
ns-271	Today he says “good lord, what the fuck happened?
ns-271	I’ve got to garden.
ns-271	Talk to you later”.
ns-271	He read my reply, which said “I’m so worried about you!
ns-271	Why would you take that?
ns-271	Where did you find it, and why would you take it?
ns-271	Eat and stay hydrated”.
ns-271	I just don’t know anymore.
ns-271	I suspected it, but I want him to be upfront about it with me.
ns-271	I love him, and he will always be my first, and I’ll always talk to him and care for him, but I don’t want to be held in limbo.
ns-271	I’m trying to move on and this is now in my head.
ns-272	I know whenever I say “talk to you later” or “good night” or whatever I want to add an “I love you”.
ns-272	Just casually.
ns-272	To see what happens.
ns-272	I know that every time I get a text from them I get super excited.
ns-272	I know when I am having a bad day, just thinking of them makes me feel so much better.
ns-272	Just knowing I can go home and text them brightens my mood ten-fold.
ns-272	I know sometimes I daydream about just holding them and being near them.
ns-272	But what I don’t know is what this means.
ns-272	I’ve known them nearly four months now.
ns-272	That’s not long.
ns-272	It makes me feel like this is an infatuation that will pass.
ns-272	To be honest, I kind of hope it is, because I don’t think it’s mutual.
ns-272	But oof, is it hitting me hard!
ns-272	Is it merely infatuation?
ns-273	Their explanation is that they’re a bad texter, or busy, but honestly so am I (I will takes days or a week to respond), but I don’t leave people on read or open messages I know I can’t respond to at the moment.
ns-273	It really isn’t that hard to send a quick “talk to you later” either to be honest.
ns-273	Finally they seem to want to engage with me and basically tell me they’re going to an event and they’d hope to see me there, which they reaffirm the next day and then on the day.
ns-273	I go to event, they never show.
ns-273	At this point I’m too stressed from a lot of other shit I got going on, and it’s not like we’re really talking, so I just block them.
ns-274	I don’t know, I need to change my mindset or this and that for my benefit and survival.
ns-274	I’m still “Ocean Serene”, but maybe I’m...
ns-274	I don’t know, that’s a tough thing to say, I never thought that my girlfriend was just a random.
ns-274	I love her to death, she is my boo and will always be it.
ns-274	Just like I said a lot of things, I’m gonna agree that if I change, the world changes.
ns-274	The advice you get, it’s always iffy.
ns-274	I want to speak for everyone, but at the same time I can only speak for myself.
ns-274	Also, I went to get some rum and coke.
ns-274	I got coke and a few other people saw it, so they bought some coke…
ns-274	erm, I hope my friends are ok (that’s all you weirdos I’m talking about).
ns-274	Random story I know.
ns-274	To be honest, I’m not ok, but I’m surviving like usual.
ns-274	Actually I’m all just a bit right and fine.
ns-274	Talk to you later.
ns-274	Talk to you later.
ns-275	[bro] Across the country?
ns-275	She acts like 500 miles is a long way.
ns-275	[me] lol, it’s 8 hours to [redacted], 7 to [redacted].
ns-275	Not a big deal.
ns-275	[bro] I suppose when you don’t maintain your vehicles, an hour’s drive could be detrimental.
ns-275	[me] lol [me] I suppose [redacted] or [redacted]’s wife ratted me out.
ns-275	Maybe I should block them too.
ns-275	[bro] Sorry for her awkward messages.
ns-275	I was in the middle of a drunk nap when she pulled up to my house, and I told her you jumped ship.
ns-275	Told her not to try to contact you, and we can see how well that went.
ns-275	[me] Shit.
ns-275	Betrayal.
ns-275	[bro] I’m sure she’s contacting you for her own self-gratification.
ns-276	I was in a toxic relationship for 4 months.
ns-276	During our dating period and a month or so into our relationship, we were great.
ns-276	One day, both of us were jealous of each other for no reason.
ns-276	I’m going to admit that sometimes when I feel jealous, I just want her to reassure me like how I reassure her that it’s all good, but she will only reassure me once and then said “bye” or “talk to you later”.
ns-276	Most of the time in an argument, it’s always my fault.
ns-276	She won’t admit to anything or say sorry.
ns-276	I will always be the one to give in so that the fight won’t continue anymore.
ns-277	And I said “But yeah yeah, you’re right.”
ns-277	And he said “Yeah, well I’ve got to go.
ns-277	I’m doing something”, and I was going to type “alright, talk to you later”, but I realized we aren’t at that level anymore.
ns-277	I didn’t like that.
ns-277	The vibe was going good.
ns-277	I didn’t have a bad vibe.
ns-277	When the conversation started.
ns-277	But once he said he’s doing something, my heart dropped.
ns-277	Like, what was he doing?
ns-277	He’s never done this before.
ns-277	This was such a different person.
ns-277	I hate it.
ns-277	What can I do?
ns-277	All these attempts I made were basically shut down.
ns-277	I like him, but I’m not trying to flirt or do anything!
ns-277	I know he doens’t like me like that.
ns-277	We talked about it.
ns-277	Right now, I’m just chatting with him.
ns-277	But he doesn’t seem like he wants to do that.
ns-277	If he doesn’t want to talk to me, he can just fucking tell me.
ns-278	I don’t know what else to put besides that I hate the current circumstance of life I live in.
ns-278	I’m going to give a little insight tomorrow.
ns-278	Ok, I lied.
ns-278	I have to reveal my age tomorrow, because if I don’t, it’ll mess up the story.
ns-278	Um, I don’t know what to type so I’ll type a worry I have.
ns-278	Um, I don’t think I’ll get the tape gun in time.
ns-278	Ok bye, talk to you later everyone.
ns-279	She said something like “but I want to make sure that we go as a friend?” thing and I was like “okay, I know”, and sometimes she talks about her relationship and she said “of course I like my long time boyfriend”.
ns-279	Yeah, whatever, right, haha.
ns-279	And here’s my question...
ns-279	Yesterday when I was at work, she messaged me saying something like “how’s your work doing?”, and I kind of replied to her with a cold tone saying “I’m at work, talk to you later”, and
ns-279	then she, kind of upset: “Okay, I mean I understand you are at work so busy, but you didn’t cut me off like this before; so I kind of get it that you don’t want to talk anymore like before.
ns-279	Got it!
ns-279	Bye!”
ns-280	And my machine fucking freezes up.
ns-280	It’s been happening for like 2 days now...
ns-280	This machine can run a goddamn $26,000 3D scanner, but 4 browser tabs on Reddit and new a chat session uses up 87% of my damn memory and 60% of my CPU power and freezes the whole damn thing up.
ns-281	Hey!
ns-281	Wait!
ns-281	I’ve got a new complaint!
ns-281	Seriously, what the fuck are you developers doing?
ns-281	Stop, please!
ns-282	If you think it’s rude to just walk away in the middle of a conversation without excusing yourself, or at least saying “got to go, I’ll talk to you later”, then it’s also rude when texting.
ns-282	I could let it go if it was a one-off.
ns-282	Things happen.
ns-282	Maybe something came up and you got distracted, etc.
ns-282	But every single person ghosts in the middle of a conversation.
ns-282	It’s really not that hard to just say “got to go, I’ll text you later” or “so-and-so just got home, talk to you later”.
ns-282	Even just “bye” or “be right back” or something!
ns-283	Today I got mad and just flat out asked him to tell me where the problem was and if I did something wrong.
ns-283	He said he was with his friends and he didn’t want to ignore them just to talk to me.
ns-283	I said it wouldn’t be a problem if he had just said something like “I can’t talk right now” or “I’m with my friends, talk to you later” or just literally anything.
ns-283	He then said I was overthinking stuff and I should “chill out”, so I left it at that.
ns-283	So am I the asshole and overthinking things
ns-283	?
ns-284	Am I the asshole for getting mad at my boyfriend after he ignored me for a few days?
ns-285	So I would usually post this on r/keto, but that subreddit is so intense about their keto.
ns-285	And I respect it.
ns-285	But, like, a girl’s got to rant.
ns-285	I started keto a few weeks ago.
ns-285	I have been doing well, and I feel like I’ve lost weight.
ns-285	Out of nowhere, I get slammed with cravings.
ns-285	My body is like “bitch, calories please”.
ns-285	I oh so badly want to make it to my goal weight and flock around on a beach in a bathing suit, and I also want to honor the tenacity that r/keto so proudly espouses in their “no cheat days” mantra.
ns-285	But, alas, another side of me wants to curl up in my bed with my favorite gluten-free dairy-free carbohydrate dense carrot cake and go to satiety land.
ns-286	As far I as I know, the concept of mini-album is only around in K-pop (maybe I-pop?).
ns-286	I’m always disappointed when a long-awaited comeback or something is only some 4 or 5-song album.
ns-286	I can tolerate a debut album, since you really don’t have a lot of material, but if you’re SNSD or something and you come out with mini after a years long hiatus like Mr.Mr, it’s kind of insulting.
ns-287	I don’t know what to say, lol.
ns-287	I’m pretty funny, not only because I manage to trip over air and choke on my own saliva far too often, but also because I’m just fucking hilarious to be honest.
ns-287	I’m from Yorkshire, and that probably makes me cooler than you, because the North is just superior, and I’m ready to die on this hill, but I guess we can be mates.
ns-287	I would really like some of those.
ns-287	Ok, I’m running out of people to laugh at my jokes.
ns-288	17M from the UK, Please be able to hold a conversation, lol.
ns-289	I don’t know what kind of dog this was, but it was so ugly.
ns-289	My god, who would own such a thing?
ns-289	Dogs with wrinkles like Pugs, Shar Peis (I don’t know how to spell it), Bulldogs, Boxers, any dog with those ugly ass wrinkles are so dumb.
ns-289	I’m not a dog hater at all; I love dogs.
ns-289	But the breeds that I mentioned are so fucking ugly and gross they shouldn’t be owned, and I’ve literally been told these kinds of dogs need surgery just to live a proper life.
ns-289	(Wrinkles over eyes cause blindness and over the nose, they can’t breathe)
ns-289	And yes, I know I’m going to get shit on by all the fucking neckbeards on Reddit that just adore their snot nose little Pug.
ns-289	I don’t even care.
ns-289	I’m so tired of people and their dogs.
ns-290	Are boobs nice?
ns-290	Because, I don’t know, I’ve never seen them before.
ns-291	Then he checks the oil level, saying that the oil also smells like gasoline, that gasoline and oil are mixing up together.
ns-291	He opens one spark plug, sees the massive leak in there literally full up.
ns-291	Let me say, oil smells like gasoline.
ns-291	I didn’t smell that one.
ns-291	That’s what the worker told me.
ns-291	Then he call his boss, and the boss says it is not gasoline, it is just oil, “that shit smells like gasoline” 🤦🏾‍♂️ Even the worker confirmed that I’m not crazy, but ay, maybe I am.
ns-291	And his worker told me he was going to seal the black thing that goes on top of the spark plug that covers it.
ns-291	Sorry, my English is not that amazing.
ns-291	He said he was putting a seal after draining the oil as he mentioned.
ns-291	As oil drained, the oil sealed the thing so oil doesn’t drip out of it and doesn’t drip to the floor.
ns-291	But it didn’t help me find the cause of why oil is getting into the spark plug, because a seal on the coil plug ignition 🤦🏾‍♂️ He tells me if the problem keeps on, it is maybe my oil catch can that is sending way too much oil and is causing the oil leak, that if the problems persist I will have to remove it.
ns-291	Sorry for the long paragraph, but I need advice.
ns-291	I need help to be honest.
ns-292	My rabbit didn’t eat or drink, so I went to check him.
ns-292	It’s been now 4 or 5 hours and I saw him now drink and eat a little bit.
ns-292	I have to give him medicines and the thing which is like food, I don’t know.
ns-292	(He has constipation so I’m going to check if he poops.)
ns-292	How do I sleep if I have to check on my rabbit?
ns-292	My sleep schedule is going to become chaotic, lol.
ns-293	I assume the time has already passed for this, but, I don’t know, I figured I may as well ask.
ns-293	I kind of forgot I even had those tickets until they announced they’d be touring again today.
ns-294	Now, my aunts (grandma’s sisters) are telling me I should not give her half of the money due to the way she treated grandma both before and after she passed.
ns-294	When my grandma first started getting sick, my sister wasn’t the best, because she had just got a new boyfriend.
ns-294	She didn’t reach out a lot to my grandma, and didn’t go to see her.
ns-294	I would go out as much as possible, but grandma was also scared of Covid.
ns-294	The month before she passed, I told my job I couldn’t come in and would drive the hour to her house and stay with her (back and forth sometimes).
ns-294	I had finals going on at the same time, and had to figure out a place to live.
ns-295	Would I be the asshole if I didn’t give my sister half of our inheritance?
ns-296	So I met this girl like 2 weeks ago and we are dating.
ns-296	Last night, everything was all right, she was happy said “good night” and “I love you” like every night.
ns-296	And the next morning when I texted her good morning, she left me on seen and blocked me.
ns-296	One of her friend said that she was sad as fuck all day because of me but didn’t want to say why.
ns-296	I don’t know what I did.
ns-296	I did nothing.
ns-296	What should I do?
ns-296	How can I contact her?
ns-296	Should I give her space?
ns-297	My girlfriend blocked me, and I don’t know why.
ns-298	Mine’s ending and all my grades are passable except for biology in which I have an F.
ns-298	This is because I made the mistake of turning things into her desk and not the bin, meaning I have like 4 or 5 assignments that I’ve done but are nowhere in the books,
ns-298	This kind of snuck up on me, because I thought they were done and filed, only to check my grades and find out they weren’t.
ns-298	Anybody else have this problem?
ns-298	(if you are going to say “I know right, I only have an 89, why couldn’t she round up?
ns-298	Fuck my life)
ns-298	I’m going to be honest, that’s not very helpful right now.
ns-299	So first off, Bard top.
ns-299	What a pick, I know right?
ns-299	Let’s drop down my main build, because it’s the best assassin play style I like.
ns-299	*my core is static/ie/RFC.
ns-299	Now, I tried many ways, and this is the best way.
ns-299	I like to safely clear and lay out poke.
ns-299	Now under certain occasions like against a Garen, I’d go what many would call Shotgun Bard, swapping out static for Runaan’s and if needed rapid firecannon for Phantom Dancer.
ns-299	Giving some more tank…
ns-299	Now, as for the other two, I actually leave them more optional picks in the ability power department or in which case magic pen.
ns-299	In this section is a few situations for more sustain.
ns-299	I’d pick up Hextech Gunblade.
ns-299	This item is phenomenal on Bard, and hits are great.
ns-299	If you’re already carrying hard, I’d go something like Liandry’s, because with the lead, no one will catch you with this, and the chunk is just Bard crazy.
ns-299	I’m tet to try Gunblade and Liandry’s together, but someday…
ns-300	Hey guys, Bard main.
ns-300	I just joined Reddit after finding out there are other off-meta Bards!
ns-300	So I main him top.
ns-300	Yes, it’s scary, but I do.
ns-300	So I’ve been getting a lot of questions about my builds from friends and happy on-lookers lately!
ns-300	I thought I’d share my builds!
ns-301	I’m 16 years old, 5’9.
ns-301	I’m new to basketball and I’d like to ask for drills I can do by myself so I can be good or even great at it.
ns-301	I only have one basketball and half a court.
ns-301	I don’t have a decent shot nor a decent handle, I could barely reach the backboard plus I have no friends so don’t even ask how good my defense is.
ns-301	The reason why I wanted to be good at it so bad is because I just want people to know me as somebody, because right now I’m a nobody, I want to be somebody.
ns-301	P.S. I’ve never played an actual basketball ever in my life…
ns-301	I know, right?
ns-302	Hi guys, I’ve always had a lot of trouble making friends and consider myself kind of standoffish and awkward at times (that cancer rising, you know) but pretty chill once you get past that.
ns-302	Super loyal and empathetic, pretty smart (when I want to be), goofy, a little chaotic, big overthinker kind of deal.
ns-302	Enneagram type 4, because apparently that matters (just kidding!).
ns-302	I’m honestly really looking for some truly kind, genuine people that might share some of my goals of breaking patterns and cycles, trying to be better, treating others with respect, dignity, and love... you get the gist :-)
ns-303	I dream of becoming a psychiatrist, so a program with medical school prerequisites would be preferable.
ns-303	Plus, I plan to take my medical school abroad (wow, big dreams much?
ns-303	I doubt I’d get in, but it wouldn’t hurt to try though).
ns-303	Academics aside, the community is also important to me.
ns-303	I’d be even more motivated to study if my teachers are kind and if my classmates are easy to get along with.
ns-303	Oh, and location too.
ns-303	I’m short, so if my classes are far, I might as well rollerskate my way through campus, just kidding.
ns-304	You set up a dramatic encounter, a dramatic fight, and then Ellie gets the upper hand.
ns-304	Then, you give the player an option.
ns-304	Do you kill Abby, or spare her?
ns-304	That way, players can decide if they want to kill someone who now seems human, and someone they feel bad for, or shoot her ass and laugh as she dies, glad you avenged your former character.
ns-304	Or, you know...
ns-304	Have Ellie kill Abby.
ns-304	Seriously, doing this would’ve prevented so much backlash.
ns-304	Easy, simple, you do the thing that the player was expected to do.
ns-304	The player goes home somewhat fulfilled.
ns-305	An opinion from someone who hasn’t played TLOU 1 or 2.
ns-306	So basically, I kind of have a crush right now, but I don’t know if I want to pursue her.
ns-306	It’s complicated.
ns-306	Right now its summer break, so I’m going to wait until school starts again to try for real again.
ns-306	I can actually talk to girls in person, because they don’t talk to me online, lol.
ns-306	I don’t know how long this series will go, but I will try to post every day until it happens.
ns-306	As of right now my confidence in finding a girlfriend is very low.
ns-306	I don’t know how long this is going to take but probably quite a while.
ns-306	All I want is for someone to love me for me and a girl that I can share my feelings with, since right now I don’t have a person to do that with.
ns-307	I would like to take this moment to say that if you’re a kid, like an elementary school kid and you’re here, where the fuck are your parents? lol, never mind, fuck them.
ns-307	You are so much better than them.
ns-308	Because I got them and no one to give them too, lmao, just kidding, unless...
ns-309	Anyone order 3 large fries, 1 medium Sprite and a McDouble?
ns-310	Hey, hi!
ns-310	Haha...
ns-310	I’m new here, I didn’t know this existed until now.
ns-310	I am extremely shy and don’t know what I’m doing here typing this, haha.
ns-310	But hey, first time for everything right?
ns-310	If we don’t click and you lose interest, then please tell me, no ghosting please.
ns-310	I will cry, lmao.
ns-310	I don’t expect to get any messages, but hey, it’s worth a try.
ns-310	P.S.
ns-310	I don’t know how to write these properly, so I tried to copy this one post I saw that was in a bullet format, oh my.
ns-310	Oh and if I don’t reply soon, it might mean I’m asleep or playing DnD, hehe.
ns-311	Never mind.
ns-311	My internet is down right now.
ns-311	Fuck.
ns-312	Well I’m going to see if I can buy some stuff off Steam now... Let’s hope there are still some good sales.
ns-313	Okay, so I was a total noob and erased my seeds since I made a new wallet that I was going to use, but I sent Monero to that wallet instead of my new one.
ns-313	I know the password but not the seeds.
ns-313	Is it possible to retrieve your wallet?
ns-313	Or how do you open the .key file?
ns-313	Edit: never mind, I’m a complete noob.
ns-313	I figured it out.
ns-314	Possible to retrive Monero wallet seeds with a .keyfile?
ns-315	user765123: No, I just had the “is now playing” thing show up.
ns-315	A:
ns-315	I know.
ns-315	A:
ns-315	Well, here we go.
ns-315	A: “easily disturbed”, lol
ns-315	A:
ns-315	Momma, help me.
ns-315	A:
ns-315	Help me.
ns-315	A:
ns-315	What’s the canon name?
ns-315	user765123: ?
ns-315	A: my name.
ns-315	A:
ns-315	What’s the canon one?
ns-315	user765123:
ns-315	There is none, pick whatever name you want.
ns-315	A:
ns-315	Oh.
ns-315	A:
ns-315	Am I a girl?
ns-315	user765123: Male.
ns-315	A:
ns-315	Argh.
ns-315	<talking about their name here> user765123
ns-315	:
ns-315	That seems like a good name.
ns-315	user765123:
ns-315	lol A: >:-)
ns-315	user765123:
ns-315	(not that it really matters.
ns-315	I just used my real life name)
ns-316	Comment So I can guess your gender based on your post history.
ns-317	Never mind… let me guess your gender instead.
ns-318	So the deadline to drop a full year course with permission from the professor is October 18.
ns-318	(Edit: never mind, this part isn’t true, please disregard).
ns-318	The deadline to drop without receiving a grade is February 9.
ns-318	Does this mean I still have to inform the professor that I’m dropping the course?
ns-318	Do I also have to get permission?
ns-318	I’m planning to take 2 other courses so I still take the same amount of credits by the way.
ns-319	I just didn’t have the confidence to speak and tell jokes and stuff.
ns-319	I was actually sweating at the presence of these other people.
ns-319	I was avoiding eye contact and trying to face as far away from them as possible.
ns-319	When I really wanted to speak to my friends, I’d quietly mumble a joke to them.
ns-319	But one time, he didn’t hear it and so he was like “what?!” really loudly.
ns-319	I felt my heart rate increase and started sweating more.
ns-319	I would just say “never mind”, because I felt like I was in the motherfucking spotlight.
ns-320	To be honest, has anyone ever experienced fighting a 2v1 or maybe a 3v1 against a tank that doesn’t die and manage to kill a least one of you?
ns-320	Talking to that rampage and crunch, but rampage didn’t pop his ult yet.
ns-320	😲 What the fuck?!
ns-320	Now, again, what would paragon be without the current pressure hunter right now?
ns-320	My guess is a team with growth totem with 2 tanks, a stun-or-not caster, a tanky as fuck fighter, and a carry that solos everything if he wants to.
ns-321	When I turn off those 2 switches, it drops down to between .28- 2.1 When they are gone for 2 or 3 days at a time and we leave switches on, it stays down also.
ns-321	I’m not positive, but I think the owners are aware and did it to cut corners.
ns-321	However, there’s always the possibility that the man behind us did it.
ns-321	So I’ve had enough.
ns-321	I finally decided I’m done paying $300 electric bills so it can be 48 degrees in my house with no hot water.
ns-321	So I know I’m really opening up a can of worms with my landlord, but it’s not legal and I shouldn’t have to pay someone else’s expenses, never mind the $6000+ that was destroyed simply by being plugged in...
ns-321	Oh, and the part where I barely sleep at night at fear of burning down, and I won’t leave my dog home alone either in fear a fire will catch while I’m not home.
ns-322	Like now I feel guilty for smiling.
ns-322	Never mind the fake ones shit, but fuck.
ns-322	Haha.
ns-322	Ugh.
ns-322	Why am I still alive?
ns-323	lol, why the fuck does smiling hurt?
ns-324	Then I see a figure slowly walking towards my general direction, and I finally look up.
ns-324	The moment I look up, Paul is looking straight at me, still walking towards me.
ns-324	I don’t say anything or look back down, because, get this: he says the first he’s ever said to me in the sexiest, most hottest, attractive way possible.
ns-324	He says “What’s up?” in this low, quieter voice but has the cutest but at the same time hottest smile ever.
ns-324	I blow up inside and I smile back, not holding back my overjoyed emotions.
ns-324	And I say “hi”, with the biggest smile I probably had.
ns-324	I’m just praying to God now that I didn’t have nasty stuff in my teeth or that my face didn’t look disgusting.
ns-324	But I look straight nail down at my food and pokerfacedely keep eating my food.
ns-324	I do that for maybe 3 seconds.
ns-324	Then I look back up.
ns-324	Paul has just stated walking away, which means he was standing there looking at me or doing God knows what for 3 seconds.
ns-325	Edit: Yes, I know.
ns-325	Plants are important.
ns-325	Oxygen.
ns-325	Useful, I know.
ns-325	But ugh.
ns-325	They really could focus on something more entertaining like how poisons and toxins affect our body.
ns-325	By the way, there some great documentaries about it T_T
ns-325	Edit
ns-325	2
ns-325	:
ns-325	never mind.
ns-325	I’ll just print the thing
ns-326	I was playing normal, just got into an alliance.
ns-326	Oops, now I’m not getting any MP!
ns-326	Try to type in chat, “I will not cheat on this game!”
ns-326	The message repeats every time I hit enter.
ns-326	What the fuck!
ns-326	I’m not cheating.
ns-326	Anyway, I type those words into the chat (“I will not cheat on this game!”) and it tells me to pay the server and turn off Adblock.
ns-326	Worst way to tell a player to turn off Adblock, but whatever.
ns-326	It tells me to turn off then refresh.
ns-326	I do and lost my best game and restart as a new player.
ns-326	10/10 I’m never playing again.
ns-326	Edit: never mind, anytime I type in the chat, the same shit happens.
ns-327	I’m going to skip the Oscar-bait shit like The Post, because there’s only some much concentrated rage at milquetoast Democrats making movies about how (extremely wonky nasal nerd voice) “politics used to be more polite.
ns-327	We need a return to the discourse.”
ns-327	I’m sure I forgot a couple.
ns-328	Will he be so much better that he’s worth more than Kinlaw and the player(s) that we pick from the extra picks we get?
ns-328	OT could be there like Thomas, but I’m just not convinced any guy we take will be better than Little entering his 2nd year.
ns-328	He has health concerns at the moment, but we also have Daley entering his 2nd year and is a decent safety net.
ns-328	Interior offensive line I think is a major problem, but there is no Nelson-like prospects that are going in the top 10.
ns-328	Edge might be a need depending on FA, and the Iowa guy (I cannot spell his name) is good, but that’s still a bit of a reach.
ns-328	If we do not resign Bradberry and Okudah is there, that’s really the only situation where I absolutely stay put.
ns-329	2 months ago, I bought a cheap ’95 Nissan truck.
ns-329	I was only locally driving, so it took the better part of a week to realize I couldn’t put it to 60mph, or that I had to floor it to hit 3500 rpm.
ns-329	(although it has a little transmission-slippage from 1st to 2nd only when dead-cold, this problem is the engine for sure as I can’t rev it past 3k in my driveway without feeling like I’m going to break something, I can only get the 3500 rpm when driving and flooring it.
ns-329	It’ll hit close to 3500 right before gear-shifts)
ns-329	I was trying to methodically rule out what could be causing this power-sap, i.e. is it the air or fuel or a clogged cat or exhaust, etc. or something entirely different?
ns-329	I ruled out “different”, I think, by seeing that it will roll down-hill just fine in neutral, so no mechanical interferences.
ns-330	Hey!
ns-330	I read somewhere that it can ruin his puppy teeth and small parts can be dangerous.
ns-330	Is it safe to give him a bone?
ns-330	They are pretty big, almost his size.
ns-331	Can I give my 2-month Boston Terrier puppy raw beef bones?
ns-332	[HELP] My puppy has suddenly refused to poop anywhere except inside.
ns-333	My friends think she said that because she was with her new man and she needed me to not blow her phone up, etc.
ns-333	Others think it’s a way for her to be evil, like think of me, because I’m never coming to get that charm.
ns-333	I think it’s some type of hoover, good or bad.
ns-333	Any insight is appreciated.
ns-333	If you’re a woman, please tell me your perspective.
ns-333	So confused, but she is clearly with someone else, and why couldn’t she call me back and why didn’t she respond to my text messages?
ns-333	She could’ve said “I’m with my boyfriend, please don’t call me”, but she didn’t.
ns-334	Just a side note: my boyfriend and I are buying a house.
ns-334	We will be moving out in 2 months.
ns-334	Once the papers are all finalized.
ns-334	I have an Australian Shepherd, 9 months.
ns-334	My boyfriend (24M) and I (25F) got her at 3 months.
ns-334	We take her on play dates every other week.
ns-334	She has a pair of dogs she likes to play tag with, a black Labrador and a small dog that is a mix of something.
ns-334	We take her to see a Rat Terrier.
ns-334	Their play style is boxing.
ns-334	And one of my room mates (25M) has a Beagle.
ns-334	He doesn’t like to play much.
ns-334	In fact, he seems kind of scared too.
ns-335	I know all of these things about my dog.
ns-335	I know that it doesn’t matter if your dog is friendly, aggressive, or otherwise, doesn’t matter if your dog is already barking and growling, or just minding its own business.
ns-335	What matters is that my dog is nervous.
ns-335	So when I hold my hand out and tell you, “no, he’s not sitting or lying down because he’s calmly waiting for you to say hi, it’s because he’s nervous and insecure”, I don’t mean it as a joke, and it’s not an invitation for you to say, “aw, well my dog/child is very friendly, so let me approach!”
ns-335	I don’t care if your dog/child is friendly or “dog savvy”.
ns-335	I don’t care if your dog “is just a puppy”.
ns-335	(why the hell is that even relevant?
ns-335	Is my dog not allowed to be nervous around other puppies?).
ns-335	I don’t care if your child is capable of not screeching “oh my God, a puppy”.
ns-336	Can you, you know, do something about your child? And also your dog?
ns-337	But with less than 3 months to go for that, I feel I’m not ready yet, but having never taken it, I have nothing to compare it to besides colleagues’ advice.
ns-337	Without knowing what I know, they can’t know if I’m actually ready yet, but many of them are pushing me to sign up for it.
ns-337	I want this bad and it would be awesome to be done 6 months from my introductory exam.
ns-337	I’m close...
ns-337	I just don’t know if I’m 2 months study close.
ns-338	Some certified advice.
ns-339	(M/5’10”/26/165-195lbs) 2 months progress, am I gaining too much weight?
ns-340	I know this sounds weird, but here’s my issue.
ns-340	About 4 months ago, I had an 3700X which died after start, crashing when I tried to play games, and a day later not booting.
ns-340	I sent to RMA, they confirmed the CPU was dead and gave my money back after 2 months.
ns-340	After that I got an 3800X.
ns-340	As soon as I tried, I got the boot code 7b, everything powered up but no reboots or video signal.
ns-340	I sent to RMA this time with the store.
ns-340	After 1 month they confirmed the CPU was faulty and sent me a new one.
ns-340	I got the new one yesterday, same issue.
ns-341	My mom (T) has always been the type where her feelings matter first and only.
ns-341	If something she does is wrong, she manipulates it into being someone else’s fault entirely.
ns-341	For example: I needed someone to babysit our then 2-month-old for 3-4 hours.
ns-341	Dad’s work had someone who had Covid.
ns-341	We opted out of them watching our son and asked my sister.
ns-341	I approached this topic as usual with T by trying to talk to her before I set it all up, because I knew it would upset her.
ns-341	T got her hopes up, then its my fault and she tried getting me to apologize for getting her hopes up.
ns-341	I talked to her days after the incident, because she didn’t call me after hanging up on me, told her how I felt about the whole thing, T promptly got off the phone.
ns-341	I never got an apology.
ns-341	B still thinks I am owed an apology, other things have happened since then due to T’s narcissism.
ns-341	I don’t expect an apology from T, because she never has once ever apologized for anything she’s ever done wrong.
ns-342	Would I be the asshole for keeping our house in the divorce so I can rent out the other rooms?
ns-343	My EBF son is 5.5 months, 75th percentile weight and ahead in most milestones.
ns-343	Since 2 months, he’s co
ns-343	-
ns-343	slept with us because of frequent night wakings.
ns-343	We have all the bad habits - including nurse to sleep and nurse to nap, yes, the entire nap.
ns-343	I’ve been sleeping 1-2 hour intervals for what feels like forever.
ns-344	TLDR: tips/support to get a 2-month baby sleeping beyond one sleep cycle in bassinet (currently replacing pacifier every hour).
ns-344	First time mother to a sweet 2-month-old girl, and I’m finding any progress we’ve made with sleeping is gone.
ns-345	First time mother struggling with sleeps.
ns-346	So I already have an orange golden chinchilla (Toto, 2 months old) and we have had Toto for 3 weeks now and felt she needed company, so we got Terri (2-month Himalayan Ragdoll) to keep each other company.
ns-346	It’s only been a few hours and she feels very sleepy, but when we pet her she sounds like a running car motor.
ns-346	Just always going “brr rrr rrr”.
ns-346	I’m not sure if she has a blocked nose, because Toto never made this kind of sound...
ns-346	Am I just being paranoid?
ns-347	Cat is making a purr noise or something similar?
ns-348	I can’t play until tomorrow but would like to know, so I can make money hunting or robbing everything and everyone.
ns-349	How much do pelts sell for online?
ns-350	Usually I’m quietly confident going into these games but with injuries, players missing etc., I’m kind of happy if we get a draw.
ns-350	I know they’re utter piss and paper-wise, we should be wiping the floor with them, but I’m just not feeling the 2/3-nil vibe at the moment!
ns-350	Anyone want to talk me round and make me feel happy and warm and confident again?
ns-351	This is the story all about how my life got flip turned upside down-wait never mind, shit meme.
ns-351	I was 6 and playing Lego Rock Band, I decided to ask for the Buddy Holly pack.
ns-351	My parents (despite being in their 40’s) said “how the shit do you know that?”
ns-351	I never realised that my parents got into Weezer.
ns-351	So that’s how I got into Weezer.
ns-352	I genuinely don’t understand how “toxic” behavior is more punished than literally int or troll.
ns-352	Well, I’ve had an account which always received those rewards for being friendly or sportsmanlike until I got in a bad streak of losses in ranked, and in a longer run my account got chat restricted.
ns-352	Then I read some of the things that had been marked as toxic behavior....
ns-352	And most of it were arguments.
ns-352	The bot that searches your in-game chat for toxic behavior after a report doesn’t understand the context.
ns-353	I asked him if I should eat cereal or just wait until the morning, but then I said “never mind, I just realized it’s almost 2.
ns-353	I’ll just wait”.
ns-353	And then he asked what would happen if I ate it right now and I said nothing.
ns-353	It’s just too late.
ns-353	Now he’s telling me to just say “fuck it” and just eat the cereal.
ns-353	So inspiring, but I just put my rubber bands in so it’s too officially late :-(
ns-354	Before I realized it was 2.
ns-355	Help, lol, oh wait, I can just Google it.
ns-355	Never mind, lol
ns-356	How to delete a subreddit.
ns-357	I know your skin isn’t perfect or you’re insecure about your nose or looks.
ns-357	But those flaws are what makes you different.
ns-357	It gives you an identity amidst all of these people that live a fake perfect life.
ns-357	You’re beautiful, because you’re you.
ns-357	Rant over.
ns-357	Actually, never mind.
ns-357	God, why did you give me this huge ass nose?
ns-357	I’m too ugly to even rant on Snapchat, so I do it on Reddit instead.
ns-357	Ok, it’s over now.
ns-357	Hopefully.
ns-358	Can I get an RIP in the chat boys?
ns-358	I was trying to go to sleep, because I couldn’t, when I got two notifications from this girl I really liked, but I didn’t look at my phone and I went back to sleep.
ns-358	Fucking kill me.
ns-358	I’ll keep you updated on what she says, because she only said my name in all caps and then a “never mind”.
ns-358	Fuck.
ns-359	I just realized I’m complaining over a 5-minute fix…
ns-360	I don’t like him or anything, but I had some dreams about him where I cheated on my boyfriend with him.
ns-360	I wouldn’t do that to him of course, but I was just wondering how bad is it to cheat?
ns-361	Me: I’m highkey liking boys more right now.
ns-361	lol, this is no culture.
ns-362	I’m still trying to fucking finish this project while studying for a final on Wednesday.
ns-362	And it’s my actual birthday tomorrow, lol.
ns-363	This is not meant as a rant.
ns-363	It’s only just informing Oro mains that they look noobs whenever they play Oro.
ns-363	Never mind, I guess this is a rant.
ns-364	Never mind, it’s back up.
ns-365	That’s like ordering food at a restaurant and then saying “ah, never mind, I want to eat somewhere else” as soon as they’re bringing the food out.
ns-366	I played a game as Rengar and I was 6/2 and got solo killed by Anvia who didn’t have Rod of Ages or Tear finished yet.
ns-366	I looked over at the replay 100 times and all I can think to my self is, if we both played the 1v1 perfectly which we both did, the Anivia will win CNA.
ns-366	Someone please explain why the fuck an Anivia is strong than a Rengar in a 1v1 when the Rengar has a gold lead?
ns-366	Actually, never mind.
ns-366	I don’t care.
ns-366	I’m just quitting this brain dead game.
ns-367	I hit her fender in a parking lot, we checked the damage and both agreed to just let it be.
ns-367	But after I drove off, she follows me for about 30 seconds and says “never mind”, so I just gave her mine and went on with my day.
ns-368	I’m so sick of hearing the same beats of Mexican music, ahh!
ns-368	Edit:
ns-368	I lied: the party started at 8 am and the music stopped just now at 7:30 pm.
ns-368	God, if I have to go through this every weekend, I’ll just kill myself.
ns-368	Edit 2:
ns-368	lol, 10 minutes later, never mind, the music started again.
ns-368	What the fuck!
ns-368	Edit 3:
ns-368	It started raining, so the party ended haha!
ns-369	People go in the dark alone.
ns-369	No one could be that stupid!
ns-369	If there’s a ghost in the house, why the hell would you go in the darkest and creepiest place in the house?!
ns-369	Then they turn the flashlight a little too far and see the ghost.
ns-369	Then they know they’re screwed.
ns-369	4. The fuck are you splitting up for?!
ns-369	There’s always this one guy in horror movies that’s like: “Guys, there’s a crazy ass killer running around so we should totally split up and get ourselves killed”!
ns-369	That’s exactly what the killer wants!
ns-370	We get it, you’re mad the P90 is good.
ns-370	Just build, lol.
ns-370	All this Reddit has been is “true_warrior is a bad person, oh never mind, he’s good” and “P90 is broken.
ns-370	I’m quitting the game”.
ns-371	lol, never mind, I’m still here.
ns-371	I can’t sleep.
ns-372	lmao, it’s just me, never mind.
ns-373	Just what the title says.
ns-373	Do you pick up insects and spiders with your bare hands?
ns-373	I’m deathly afraid of insects and spiders, so I don’t know what to do.
ns-373	I want to kill them before they get away.
ns-374	Play a scuffed 24-hour WOW livestream filled with condescending undertones, belittling, and shitty half-assed ill-prepared gameplay.
ns-374	Throw begging, depression and sob stories on top of it and call it couples stream.
ns-375	An Altarian virus, anything is possible.
ns-375	In fact, that day on Onias Three, you were infected with the cell of its hosts ten days ago.
ns-375	You have been in a coma, delirious.
ns-375	Your fever broke this morning.
ns-376	I don’t have one, because I’m 17 and haven’t gotten around to it (and no, I’m not driving, because I’m terrified) and that I haven’t gotten my gender marker changed, so no updated documents at all.
ns-376	I have a passport from a while ago from before transitioning, so that doesn’t have an updated name either.
ns-376	So I have no idea what to do, because I’m going to an event with them on the 14th.
ns-376	If it helps, my dad’s a flight attendant (has been for like ever).
ns-376	Should I cancel?
ns-376	There is always next year, but, like, I’m lonely in real life, because my boyfriend is an hour away, and as much as I love my other real life buddies, I’d like a breath of fresh air :-(
ns-377	I don’t know if I will.
ns-377	If I do, I will be in my mid 30’s, because I want to live life my way.
ns-377	But I need to have sex to have kids and that isn’t going to happen (because honestly “me too”).
ns-378	I have to go camping for a scuba certification.
ns-378	There is a grill and they will eat burgers.
ns-378	But I am on a vegetarian diet.
ns-378	(I eat some animal products but much less than I did before.
ns-378	I eat 80% vegetarian)
ns-379	I got pretty close with an equalizer with a little low end and high end shaved off, going into a soft clipper.
ns-379	The equalizer before it makes it Slam.
ns-379	I was going to try distortion and a limiter after, when I get off work.
ns-379	(The limiter was highly suggested in the last post, so hopefully that’ll do the trick)
ns-379	I’m just looking for advice!
ns-380	You can easily get an infinite powerlock in longer fights.
ns-380	I have a 4/40 Dr Octopus, and I see some pretty good numbers on critical hits and SPS, so not bad in damage either (like vision).
ns-380	A very viable option for AW attack.
ns-380	and also arenas, as you don’t have to bait out in those small fights, because you never let them reach SP3 before you finish it.
ns-381	Get ready boys.
ns-382	Pogo will not open for me.
ns-382	It keeps saying this device is blah blah blah… you guys know what I’m talking about.
ns-382	Anyway, to fix this, I am on Android 6.0 before the security update and I have root with Magisk 16.0.
ns-383	Personally, I think VII was (alongside RB1) the best Neps games in the entire franchise, what with having a storyline that doesn’t come off as too edgy nor melodramatic like Mk2/RB2, but neither as over-the-top like V/RB3, having the exact and necessary amount of seriousness and comedy.
ns-383	The characters got much better developed, and everyone (specially Vert, Nepgear and the Twins) got their own time to shine and of course, it proves that the events don’t always have to rely on Neptune’s presence.
ns-384	Great bait, mate.
ns-384	I relate, straight appreciate, and congratulate.
ns-384	I rate this bait an 8/8.
ns-384	Please no hate, I’m straight irate.
ns-384	Create more, Can’t wait.
ns-384	We should conversate.
ns-384	I won’t berate.
ns-384	My number is 8888888,
ns-385	I’ve taken quite a few of these classes as a physics major for my electives... and I will take no more.
ns-385	They go up to the board and just starting writing math: Meh, ok, that’s fine.
ns-385	They then use shit like A subtract 1 through A subtract 20 for variables.
ns-385	In fact, I have a linear algebra book that did this... A’s for everything.
ns-385	The pages were just matrices filled with A’s.
ns-385	Just draw a weird shape or something - anything but that shit!
ns-386	Scariest thing ever mate.
ns-387	Well, well, here we are again, frustrated, angry in front of my phone.
ns-387	What a neat way to start isn’t it?
ns-387	All of you readers are my therapy and I don’t owe you a cent.
ns-387	Perfect, right?
ns-387	If you are like me you are probably not going to read it all because of your short attention span, so let’s keep it short (what a genius way to write after a long introduction saying “keep it short - I’m a genius aren’t I?”)
ns-387	Well I tried explaining to my buddies that porn is kind of shabby, and yeah just bad, and you know who listened…
ns-388	Hey, I just want to know what games I can run on this PC and which not.
ns-389	I was a spy, and on the first night I was jailed and I proudly told the jailor my role.
ns-389	I also got attacked whilst in jail.
ns-389	When day 2 had begun, Mafia and Serial Killer had made their kills.
ns-389	I proudly said: “I was attacked while in jail!”
ns-389	Wrong move.
ns-389	Jailor decides to jail me again and asks me “You were attacked while you were in jail?” and I answer “yes mate”.
ns-389	He then tells me that what I am saying is bullshit, because Serial Killer and Mafia have already made their kills.
ns-389	Then he executes me.
ns-389	Seriously?!
ns-390	Oh boy, you are too dumb for the movie, boy.
ns-390	The director was like “shit, it’s about the hidden meanings you have to find, boy, like you know it doesn’t spoon-feed you the film, you know?”
ns-390	Like shit, why does it have to explain, mate.
ns-390	Just imagine what happened, you know?
ns-390	It’s not like I pretend it has a deeper meaning than what it has, you know?
ns-391	Yet when fully charged for the first 30-60 minutes, it’s always on!
ns-391	Which is beautiful!
ns-391	Lastly, if I do not use the Smok Alien for an extended amount of time (say at night when sleeping), the battery reduces when left in the mod and the mod is turned off.
ns-391	What the fuck, mate?
ns-391	I just want to understand if all of this is the same for everyone, or is it just me?
ns-391	In searching Google, I cannot find an answer to any of these questions.
ns-391	Other than these issues, I am really enjoying the mod.
ns-391	It’s just a fucking ball ache every single time I want to vape to have to wait for the fucking thing to go through its motions before I can puff...
ns-392	Every time I log on, I want to chill away from keyword NMZ, and play Xbox and be fat, right, but lately I log on, play RS away from keyword for like 20 seconds and I get logged out, and it’s fucking annoying.
ns-392	Is it my internet connection or is it the servers or what?
ns-392	It’s pissing me off, mate.
ns-393	Next we have my statistics class, and I didn’t realize that we had additional homework to do online as well as the written homework; and so my grade was a 70 something, and then I bombed my final for it because of some family emergency that popped up involving my uncle and a car in a hit and run.
ns-393	So then my band class is basically easy A as it’s show up to a weekly practice and go to the one concert, and so I passed that.
ns-393	Good game, easy, mate.
ns-394	Dramatic death scenes and bringing the characters back with a gag do not go hand in hand.
ns-395	So I finally got to Blighttown, and was strolling about, minding my business, and a sniper started throwing darts at me.
ns-395	So I was like “what the fuck, mate?” and hid behind some destructible wood.
ns-395	After a certain time, he stopped attacking, so I showed myself and he reappeared, and started with the darts again.
ns-395	So a couple dozen darts after, I simply get +500 souls, and that purple moss stuff.
ns-395	So what the hell happened there.
ns-395	Did the motherfucker just kill himself in shame or what, he simply died all of the sudden?
ns-396	This year’s rookie game is actually going to be real exciting. What line-ups do you want to see?
ns-397	I love this show, but sadly I’m near to finishing it already.
ns-397	What is this called and are there other movies or shows based on this really special kind of story?
ns-397	I never watch movies or… so sorry about my lack of vocabulary on this though, is this called dystopian?
ns-397	Well I’m really lost, but I just want some other stuff like this to watch, it’s crazy!
ns-398	Has it happened to anyone else?
ns-398	It happened to me a number of times.
ns-399	So if you’re on leg 2, you have to win 10 consecutive games for the XP and coins, 10 stamina for 40 tickets.
ns-399	Get the fuck out of here, EA!
ns-400	But now it just doesn’t make sense.
ns-400	You only get 1 ticket per match, and if you are lucky, you will get 10 extra in every 20 matches.
ns-400	Only in leg or WC 1.
ns-400	This tournament was the one thing free-to-play was always able to do because of the low cost of entrance and the rewards were good enough compared to how many matches you need to play.
ns-400	You got a player extra and if you don’t like him, use it as XP.
ns-401	[Suggestion] if you don’t like the new WT, then don’t play it.
ns-402	Closed tech support?
ns-402	It’s, 1:30am and you’re a billion-dollar, global enterprise.
ns-402	What the literal fuck?
ns-402	Was your heating bill too much this month so you can’t make your rent?
ns-402	You mismanaged bunch of fools.
ns-403	So, long story short, I forgot to fill out the housing application for the fall ’22 semester, and I’m on the waitlist since April.
ns-403	Housing isn’t guaranteed when you’re not a freshman, and my income isn’t enough for rent so… There’s a possibility, I might be homeless.
ns-404	My answer is simple: Have you seen the men nowadays?
ns-404	No fucking competition.
ns-404	Most men this day are thirsty as fuck.
ns-404	The era of gentlemen is over.
ns-404	They are either idiots, look like a half-assed rapper or are complete assholes.
ns-404	Often times all of that.
ns-404	In their primitive brains, they grab and grunt at everything with two legs.
ns-404	And I mean that literally.
ns-404	But – that’s good for you.
ns-404	If you just behave like a decent human being, then you are already better than 80% of the other dudes.
ns-405	I (24M), an accountant at a traveling company.
ns-405	We ask our clients to pay their debts weekly, and today I called one of our agents and a girl picked up.
ns-405	She was their accountant and asked her if they will pay their debts, and she said “yes, I will be at your company at 21:00”.
ns-405	I said “ok, and at 21:00, she came by and asked who is the accountant”.
ns-405	I said “I am, please follow me to the room”.
ns-405	She came and I asked her how much did she bring.
ns-405	She said “I have $1300 with me”, which will not cover all of their debts by the way, so I brought a receipt and wrote down the amount and the company name and then I asked her for her name.
ns-405	She smiled and looked at me and said my name.
ns-406	So none of my friends are answering me 😭😭 So, it’s time to make some new ones!
ns-406	I’m in the mood to call, so let me know if you’re down!
ns-406	Looking to talk to people around my age.
ns-406	I’ve posted before so you can check out my profile for more info.
ns-406	I’m a little lazy right now 🥴
ns-406	Anyways, let me know what your favorite type of music is 🙃
ns-407	I had been wearing Lane Bryants Lounge Bras the past four-ish years, and so this was the first time in a very long time that I wore a bra with wire.
ns-407	So come Monday, I wore my new bra with wire that fit perfectly at the store, but after a few hours it felt so uncomfortable!
ns-407	I am worried I wasted my money… :-(
ns-408	I’m so miserable and seriously just want to cancel my trip but don’t want to disappoint my husband.
ns-408	He’s been looking forward to a vacation for so long.
ns-408	I’m dreading the plane ride so bad!
ns-408	Luckily the flare is a bit higher and not right where I make contact when sitting, but it still hurts like a motherfucker.
ns-408	I’m going to be walking around in 40 degree weather with a big angry boil on my ass.
ns-408	God help me 😫
ns-409	Hey, there.
ns-410	Hi guys, I was drinking with my friends from the US and my boyfriend and everyone’s fallen asleep, and I want to play some truth or dare or drink, so if you have Discord or Kik, just message me, owo
ns-411	So I just had my baby with the man of my dreams 4 months ago :-) and it felt like I was living my fairytale life.
ns-411	I was in my exact vision I had, but then, long story short, postpartum with new emotions had me pull a crazy move and I checked his phone about a month ago now, only to find out he was meeting up with a chick, doing favors for her, spending time in her room and texting a lot, all while I was pregnant.
ns-411	Now he and her both say they are just friends and never hooked up (yes, I contacted her number), lol, but I don’t want to lose my man, though I also saw he has dating profiles and he says he doesn’t do it all the time.
ns-411	And he won’t do it anymore.
ns-411	I don’t want my baby’s parents to split, plus I love him and want our vision to carry on.
ns-411	But how?
ns-411	Please help.
ns-411	Can I?
ns-411	Or should I trust him again ?
ns-412	Day 17 of posting Corgi stuff (sorry for not posting for so long)
ns-413	I have insomnia and I can’t sleep at night, and it’s just like I have so many ideas at night that just so many ideas keeping my up at night.
ns-413	Please tell me how sometimes I can get better sleep.
ns-413	Because of that, I almost failed school and because of skipped lessons, and people tell me to listen, but just, like, I talk with somebody, and then I just think of something.
ns-413	I forgot what I was about to say, and I had a math tutor, but iI couldn’t focus and just also my mind is like chaos people.
ns-413	Tell me.
ns-413	Oh, I don’t want to take medication and I’m sensitive to medicine.
ns-414	Digital cameras are either super expensive, or the type of camera you would use for vlogging or things like that.
ns-414	She probably already has one also.
ns-414	A real digital movie camera costs so damn much.
ns-414	So I opted for an analog one.
ns-414	Now, 8mm/Super 8 have an affordable price, 16mm doesn’t cost much, and 35mm costs a lot, so I think I’m going for a Super 8.
ns-414	But then how does it work?
ns-414	lol, I mean, I buy her a Super 8, but I should also buy her a video recorder, and some VHS… things like that.
ns-414	I don’t know how it works.
ns-414	Please can someone explain to me what should I do.
ns-415	How do you guys do it?
ns-415	It’s so scary, but I want to last forever with him, and I know I can’t tell the future, but we’ve been through so much together.
ns-415	How do you guys keep it going through all the obstacles life throws at you... how?
ns-416	Do you want to run some Minecraft? XD
ns-417	I’m bored and my friends are busy or out right now, so...
ns-418	I finished the game for the first time today.
ns-418	What a wonderful and amazing game.
ns-418	It hits right in the feels and fucks your mind up at times.
ns-418	My ending was sad.
ns-418	Kara and Alice die (I am bad at controls), North dies, Hank dies, Marcus is successful, but I let Connor kill him, because I guess I was doing kind of a role-play where Connor is the villain and the outcome is realistic.
ns-418	I will try to open other openings.
ns-418	But yes, the game was so good.
ns-419	Hi guys, this year was my third year at Glastonbury, and I loved it so much and hope you guys did too!
ns-420	I am an aspiring doctor/medical student, and so seeing a lot of medicine-related subjects as early in our first semester I was so excited.
ns-420	Then UPCA results came in, surprise!
ns-420	I passed for UPLB BS Biology!
ns-420	To be honest though, this wasn’t my priority program, so of course I had mixed emotions.
ns-420	I was elated to finally be a scholar, but I was also worried, because I’m not really as interested in Biology as invested I already was in Physical Therapy.
ns-420	Sure, I could learn to love Biology, sure I could transfer to UPM the next year, but that’s not certain.
ns-421	I will play with anyone on 2K21.
ns-421	I’m an 87 over 3 level scorer.
ns-421	As one that will play with anyone, REP and OVR don’t matter.
ns-421	I have no one to play with most of the time, and no randoms want to play with me.
ns-421	Please play with me.
ns-421	I promise I won’t sell.
ns-421	I can shoot.
ns-421	I have an 81 three, but I can shoot.
ns-421	I’m a shooting guard.
ns-422	I need someone who knows how to land planes on PC to help me.
ns-422	That’s all.
ns-422	I just need you to land the plane.
ns-422	I know how to do the rest of the mission, but the plane has been messing me up for hours.
ns-422	Please help as soon as possible.
ns-422	My discord is SingSong254.
ns-422	Contact me there, then I’ll give you my Ubisoft account information.
ns-422	Thanks.
ns-423	Help, I need someone who knows how to fly planes well on PC to join me.
ns-423	Let’s fucking go!
ns-424	What’s up guys?
ns-424	I drop around 30 kills a game right now, and I’m trying to get out of low ranks and get into Platinum.
ns-424	If you’re good at the game but simply don’t have a Stack, add me on Discord and we can rank up together.
ns-425	Just to clarify, when I say “anything” I mean anything within the FM’s current power.
ns-425	So no answers like “remove the nukes” or “boot the royals”.
ns-425	We cannot do that (not yet at least…).
ns-426	You become the first minister tomorrow and you can do anything without repercussions.
ns-426	What do you do?
ns-427	Me and my real life friends need a team that we (or especially I) can VOD review in order to learn about tarping, switching layers and positioning.
ns-427	I was thinking Wolf/Soldier/Wilkinson but I’m not sure if there are any better ones.
ns-427	Preferably EU as we are EU, and some stuff happening is basically exclusive to EU, lol, but I guess it could be NAE as well.
ns-427	Thank you!
ns-428	Looking for someone to play with right now.
ns-428	No toxics and no obnoxious people.
ns-428	I don’t fuck with that.
ns-428	18+ NAE.
ns-428	I just play for fun.
ns-428	You can be bad.
ns-428	I don’t care about skills 😇
ns-429	One word I simply can’t say properly is water...
ns-429	It actually hurts my brain trying to add the T, and I sound American if I do or still say wut-ta.
ns-429	I don’t know why it’s so hard for me to say, to be honest.
ns-429	I was just wondering what people’s thoughts are when you meet people who drop H’s and have glottal stops.
ns-430	So I got a Sky Q Mini Box for upstairs.
ns-430	It doesn’t work.
ns-430	I have to wait until late March for an engineer. lol
ns-431	So I will be starting a job next week and desperately need to move down to the city its based out off, as a daily commute is impossible.
ns-431	Looking for single bedroom flats or flat-shares is a legitimate issue as three letting agents in the city own them all, and are only letting to students.
ns-432	Vacuum won’t stop sucking.
ns-432	Please send help.
ns-432	Is it going to blow?
ns-433	Basically, if you didn’t know what that is, it’s basically an example of two sentences.
ns-433	One says “Let’s eat granny” making it seem like someone’s going to eat their nan.
ns-433	However, the other example says “Lets eat, granny”, implying a different meaning to the sentence.
ns-433	A pretty creative way to teach kids to use commas, I guess.
ns-434	I literally couldn’t have been more at fault I just drove straight into this woman’s Golf while changing lanes (it was raining and I did not see it).
ns-434	She seemed nice but understandably pissed.
ns-434	She took my insurance and my number and said it’s my choice if I want to go through insurance and she would call me.
ns-434	The crash damage was minute to my car and I think to hers as well, just very minor body work and paint, maybe a small dent.
ns-435	What broadband do I get?
ns-435	I’ve had Virgin for 8 years, and holy shit, is it slow for £40 monthly.
ns-435	Is it the old router or do I just switch to a cheaper BT or whatever?
ns-436	Jeans, T-shirt, steel-cap boots, boiler suit (lol), high vis, gloves, goggles, dust mask, ear protection.
ns-436	Help.
ns-436	I’m melting…
ns-436	Edit: the heat has got to my spelling ability first.
ns-436	The end is nigh.
ns-437	I’m sure as eggs is eggs that I’m not the only one that goes to the gas pump, and I want say £10, 9 times out of 10 it will go £10.01.
ns-437	Bloody things are rigged like a slot machine, I swear, lol.
ns-438	lol - small acknowledgement of a joke you sort of enjoyed but didn’t actually laugh to.
ns-438	LOL - adults and people who don’t really know how the internet works use this
ns-438	Lol - I’m not sure why this came up, but it’s likely an autocorrect, but if anyone types this on purpose they are probably a huge dweeb.
ns-438	Business-lol is what it has been named.
ns-438	LoL - Grandma lol, confused with lots of love.
ns-438	It’s also confusing because of League of Legends.
ns-438	loool - now, I think my girlfriend pronounces this, but she says that this one would rhyme with “spool”, but I think it’s the drawn-out “o”.
ns-438	So yeah, I think this is actual lols, she thinks it doesn’t exist.
ns-438	lolll - when I hear her say “loool”, this is what she says she is actually saying.
ns-438	I sort of get it.
ns-438	but I still think that’s “loool”,
ns-438	You can’t repeatedly pronounce a consonant.
ns-439	So, when is Big Ben going to bong again?
ns-440	But the filters cost £15 a pop!
ns-440	Can anyone reccomend one?
ns-440	Preferably under £50!
ns-440	Also, does anyone have tips on how to reduce dust in my house that are not energy consuming (that don’t require me to stand for lengths of time).
ns-440	I have just bought tumble dryer balls to hopefully help reduce lint on my clothing.
ns-440	It seems no matter what I do, I literally can’t keep the dust at bay for more than 24 hours, and I am losing my mind.
ns-441	It’s 10pm, 28°C, and my bum is literally melting.
ns-442	Saturday session three and chat.
ns-443	If this bear isn’t named Beary McBearface, we have failed as a society.
ns-444	It’s 32°C here inside my flat.
ns-444	I have taken the t-shirt off and soaked it in cold water.
ns-444	I’m wearing it.
ns-444	What genius ways are you keeping cool whilst working from home or somewhere extremely hot with no AC?
ns-445	Bloody lovely fucking weather, isn’t it?
ns-446	16 hours in Wetherspoons.
ns-447	Okay, so I went out with my girlfriend to go to 7-11 and I had my hair in my face, a hoodie, and a mask, and someone called me he/him.
ns-447	Bruh, I’m so happy right now, what the fuck (I’m non-binary and use all pronouns, but nobody has ever used he/him for me and it feels really good)
ns-448	To the neighbor that went out of their way just to check on me, I appreciate that.
ns-449	I just wanted to say from one Gen Z to Millennials, good on you guys.
ns-449	I hope you find what you’re looking for.
ns-449	It’s been fun being your little buddies in life.
ns-450	Remember, there’s a lot of fish in the sea!
ns-451	As somebody that doesn’t experience a lot of positive moments, this subreddit does make me smile :-)
rm-0	My favorite Obama quote: "Michael and I also wanna uh, acknowledge, uh.....yy...y.yy..uuuhhh..yyy....your son Jack, who deployed today."
rm-1	New-ish player, couple of questions about parrying, etc
rm-2	Basically the title.
rm-2	We're both xxx majors (I'm a dual xxx and yyy major while she's a xxx major and yyy minor, so we are taking 2-3 classes together every semester until graduation in May 2018).
rm-2	While I wouldn't say I'm smarter than her, things tend to come more naturally to me, and I'm a good test-taker, while she has a lot of test anxiety (will often get questions wrong that me and her practice right before the exam, will freak out about not having a formula that was on the formula sheet, etc.), but she easily studies more than I do.
rm-3	Me [20F] with my friend [23F] of 2-3 years; we're both in college together, and she gets massively down on herself every time she takes an exam.
rm-3	It's driving me crazy, how to deal?
rm-4	Her: oh where's this ice luge at haha
rm-4	Me: probs my friend's hotel room/wherever he can find a place for it
rm-4	Me: came to <insert city> w my frat and a sorority – that's why he's getting it
rm-4	Her: gotchaaa
rm-4	Her: what frat and sorority I'm in xxxx
rm-4	Me: yyy. sorority is zzz
rm-4	Me: you're interesting tho.
rm-4	I want to hang out w you.
rm-4	When this week ?
rm-4	Her: uh maybe Friday?
rm-4	Me: ayy yes
rm-4	Me: Friday
rm-4	*one day later*
rm-4	Me: <girl's name> we're hanging out tmro, right?
rm-5	How to go from # to date?
rm-6	i just pretty much dismissed what she said by saying a vibe is not captured by pre googling and confirmed the time that ill be there at.
rm-6	If she gives any further resistance I think ill just next her/ ignore/not respond / agree with her that she can't handle the place , or tease her about the crazy high standards she has for a first frikken date
rm-7	This is a nagging annoyance I have with the word text object.
rm-7	Suppose the cursor is located in the "aaa" word, and I want to yank four words, *without* selecting the spaces after "ddd":> xxx **aaa bbb ccc ddd** yyy
rm-8	It is the bar with the team comp and the status of each characters that is use to follow report team ( like in the actual world cup) .
rm-8	It can be tweak down to not reveal to much info about the red team, but it will make following the killfeed easier and you won't have to use tab
rm-9	The part I'm humming is like "word word word wo-o-o-ord" x2.
rm-9	So he draws out the 4th (?) word.
rm-9	I think it was something like "fly-y-y-yyy."
rm-9	I'm pretty sure it's a popular song, I've heard it many times.
rm-9	Thanks!
rm-10	Having trouble with if / then / else / end in a repeat loop.
rm-11	Hahaha.
rm-11	OMG it's terribl-....yyy funny!
rm-12	I went grocery shopping
rm-12	I'm down to my last dollars soon and I can't just eat beer and cigarettes
rm-12	then I set them down so I didn't have to carry them across the street to get beer (it's cheaper at Adventures First Stop)
rm-12	then I walked back and forgot my groceries
rm-12	walked all the way home and ah shit, I'm getting shin splints from all this walking up and down the hill
rm-12	I live on a hill. down. the middle, really.
rm-12	i imagine it's like an amateur San Fran
rm-12	so I walked back and got them.
rm-12	no crime round these parts.
rm-12	not much, anyway.
rm-13	Hope the title makes sense -
rm-13	Have a list of names "john.baker" (no spacing between names other than the period) and need it broken into 2 colums "john" and "baker"
rm-13	Thanks!!
rm-14	Have To Break Up Format "xxx.yyy" Into two seperate colums "xxx" and "yyy"
rm-15	I am confusion???
rm-15	whats going on lol.
rm-15	This is my first time with sfu mail,
rm-15	after the sem I haven't touched anything school related until today heh, so idk how to fix this
rm-16	Even better for me it would be:
rm-16	It would be an unbeleafable loss to leta broken an thus spilt bottle be wasted with no return.
rm-16	So to show my sincerest appologies for bumping staight into a nobel that half marched in his drunken stupor, downthe sidewalk, straight out of a likor store and making him drop his bottle worth more than what I suppose one of themerchants off the mainsteet makes in a month, I was offerd to finish the wasted goods, less they spoil any further.
rm-16	"Y-y-yyy-yes sire! May the heavens cry before your mercyfull heart!”
rm-16	"Now get lost! This is no place for desease ridden vermin like you.”
rm-16	"O-off course my lord!”
rm-16	I ran. Back down the alley I squirmed my way out of. Filled to the brim with anger and shame.
rm-16	Sidestreets and alleyways, down I went. Further and furhter out of sight.
rm-17	He, soon as he sawThat I was weeping, answer'd, "Come with me."
rm-17	Onward he mov'd, I close his steps pursu'd.
rm-17	Ent'ring he led me with him on the boundsOf a great circle itself encirclign a great abyss.
rm-17	Ere, I beheld an uneven land with lava pyramids cover'd,With sickly farms of melons and carrots, near barren of life Save for those imprison'd in it, who, though they surroundedUs, dar'd not approach for fear of master.
rm-17	As mine ear could note, the sound was heard of screams, Cries, and explosions that made th' eternal airTremble, caus'd by slaughter, starvation, withering, and Grief felt by those multitudes, many and vast,Of men, women, and children.
rm-18	I recently returned to d2 after several year, now I’m windering:
rm-18	Where do you guys sell/buy your stuff?
rm-18	Do you just make a game "O xxx N yyy" and hope for the best?
rm-18	Or are there a website that’s more efficient?
rm-19	Who is a former (or still) important person in your country, that constantly compromitise himself/herself on social media?
rm-20	Its not until my next billing cycle i notice somtjing was off.
rm-20	I was a bit lower then normal and i keep a vary close eye on my expences.
rm-20	I looked over my bank stanments and there is was.
rm-20	My NEW prim bill.
rm-20	I was super confued and got ahold of amazons custmer suport.
rm-20	They helped me as much as they could, but becuase i was receiving my servese through the phone company i would have to go though them and fiugher out the problem.
rm-20	The next day i had off i walked in and talked to a vary sweet girl who tried to understand what my problem was.
rm-20	We kinda talked in a circle for a bit as i tried to explain what the amazon costmer service told me.
rm-20	We looked me up in there system and there i was 2 lines but no prime membership for either one of us.
rm-20	She could see the date i opened my first line and then the 2ed.
rm-20	Both dated added up to what i had told her before.
rm-20	She stared at the compurter screan for awhile with a confused look on her face.
rm-21	anyways, these terrible memories kept haunting me, so yesterday i finally mustered up the courage to message him.
rm-21	me: hey how's everything
rm-21	him: it's been time
rm-21	me: sorry abt last year,
rm-21	i was super awkward around you lol
rm-21	him: lol nah dwai
rm-21	*DRUM ROLL PLEAAE*
rm-21	me: tbh i liked you blah blah blah
rm-21	him: haha you could've just told me!
rm-21	next time you see me just say hi.
rm-21	do you still go to (school)?
rm-21	I'm not like r/Nicegirls but that reply didn't sit well with me.
rm-22	I'm OUT BOIS :)
rm-23	Now I obviously can't get out and shut it on the main road so I pull down a few side streets and ensure that no one fucking knows I've quickly jumped out and shut it.
rm-23	I jump back in and drive home like nothings happened.
rm-24	I don't remember specifically which, I think both bugs do it, but here in Florida there's a particular bug that makes a loud sound 100× longer than when it's not making a sound.
rm-24	I'd describe it as that trademark dessert ambiance sound.
rm-25	Locusts/Grasshoppers/etc can shut the hell up
rm-26	ive searched far and wide across the internet with nothing to show for it.
rm-26	could even go woah eee ahh ahh/ oh eee ahh/
rm-26	possiblities are endless and i know its hard
rm-26	just wondering if anyone knows it thanks
rm-27	What to do - plants now waaay small for its age imo and started to grow pistils
rm-27	- should I chop n restart or ???
rm-28	How do you get destiny delicacies
rm-28	I've seen a few ppl have them but I've never got one
rm-28	idek where you get them
rm-28	if anyone knows it would be alot of help☺
rm-29	Everytime i listen to him sht makes so much sense, even tho i dont know what he is talking about,
rm-29	that leads me to belive that either that guy is a genius who can articulate whats going on in the economy right now in a brilliant way, or he may be missing something?
rm-29	I mean what should i listen to if i rly wanna find out the truth if schiff is just "bias to Gold" and thats the reason why he is so hard on the current economy etc.
rm-30	This wouldn’t be an issue if y’all servers ask in the beginning do u guys want a separate check so it won’t be awkward.
rm-30	Also why restaurants have to be set up like that
rm-30	why u can’t just get up to the cashier and pay ur fucking share or food.
rm-31	So idk why o got on everyone nerves about the separate checks....
rm-32	But every time, my nmom says that can't be true because when she was my age, her periods were 3 days long and super light.
rm-32	"It barely ever affected me, so how can it be affecting you so much?"
rm-32	Umm idk, maybe its bc we're DIFFERENT PEOPLE with DIFFERENT BODIES???
rm-33	Does anyone elses nmom treat you like you're overreacting about your period pains?
rm-34	Passed my faa ppl written!!!
rm-35	Alright y’all. I think I mis-tagged this earlier so I’m trying again.
rm-35	I got some not fun fungal acne from running daily w a face mask on my chin/jawline, forehead, & lower cheeks.
rm-35	Once I identified it, **I switched from a face mask to a face shield while running** (I have no issue w being over 12+ ft from other ppl / usually don’t pass anyone on my runs anyways), and then have used the following routine to nuke it over the course of 3 weeks.
rm-36	Had never heard of this "influencer" before and consider myself pretty internet saavy.
rm-36	I then lost interest in her bc her IG wasn't that interesting.
rm-36	She popped back on my radar with the Nancy thread and then she disappeared from my mind again until the Anna article came out and then I took a great interest in checking in on her bc I just found her funny and her antics amusing (in a sad way).
rm-36	So this has been on my mind for a while:
rm-36	How does she continue to have such loyal fans who will send her $$ bc she claims to not being able to afford food or rent or whatever when there is photographic evidence all over her apartment of her bougie taste in decor, perfumes (Byredo perfume costs anywhere from $200-300 a pop), shit tons of plants and flowers which aren't cheap.
rm-37	basically I just found out that this 1 girl is only snapping me again cuz my friend basically told her to (told a friend to tell her) and now I’m 99% sure she’s just snapping me to be nice (plus the delivery times and opened times shit are mad long).
rm-38	what should I do from here
rm-38	someone pls lmk
rm-39	Like I don't rly care what mean shit ppl on the internet say.
rm-39	But when i got nobody IRL all I have is the internet and it do kinda hurt a bit when i just want to vent my problems.
rm-39	And I'd be fine if it got maybe a single upv*te and no comments and I'd be fine.
rm-39	But instead, it's full of people saying
rm-40	I don't like when ppl type huge ass paragraphs or dump a lot of stress on me bout their problems
rm-40	I don't like when ppl mumble on the phone or if they ramble on and it's all about then.
rm-41	I’m talking about "ppl" instead of people "u" or "ur" instead of you or your, "tho" instead of "though" and so on.
rm-41	It’s getting old, and you look like an idiot when you spell like this.
rm-41	just type out the word,
rm-41	it isn’t hard.
rm-42	Maybe a lil earlier idk cause I'm usually at work but my download speed is now stuck at the 64mbs range.
rm-42	Now I understand at peak times it should drop, I even understand that since more ppl are at home I'm gonna see lower numbers, but to go from 500 to 60.
rm-43	I`m courios how likely post on my personal space will be shown to ppl.
rm-43	Pls write "+" in the comment if you see this.
rm-44	hm, mandatory title
rm-45	If anyone says anything remotely offensive on the internet everyone just has to say you can die or something.
rm-45	Do we really care that much?
rm-45	Not really tbh
rm-46	Damn some ppl need to stop overreacting to stuff on the internet geez
rm-47	I’ve come up with a list of all the questions I could think about (there’s kinda a lot lol), so I would reaaaaally appreciate it if someone would take the time to answer them.
rm-47	If anyone is willing to PM me and chat about their test day experience and answer all my questions, that would be great too!
rm-48	I’m gross and only brush in the morning.
rm-48	I guess I see the need bc who the fuck cares.
rm-49	But now it seems that y'all done made grits without the butter and made us madder than a wet hen, I must say!
rm-49	We were fixin to tour more plantations than Carter's got little pills but you done gone and brought up them "slave owners" now.
rm-49	Ain't amountin to nothin more than a hill of beans!
rm-49	If I had my druthers, I'd da just taken my business over yonder to the white-friendly plantation and learnt me somethin decent about history.
rm-49	All this chicanery has got me worn slap out!
rm-49	Y'all get along now, ya hear?
rm-50	How do I break of a relationship with my 'friend'?
rm-51	basically I put my skate account in my Instagram bio cuz I have no posts on my main and I’m kinda insecure abt my body (in some of my clips I’m shirtless and ppl won’t expect me to be like shredded or sum shit if they add me) and today I got like 3 followers (girls from dif towns who don’t know me).
rm-51	im really picky tho bc I don’t wanna have a relationship unless I actually feel like I’d really fuck w the person and be into them a lot so I didn’t follow any of them back.
rm-52	bro ive gotten added and unadded on ig so many times today that it’s kinda a confidence boost lmao
rm-53	Honestly, most of the posts or memes here are either from ppl who read the novels or the manga.
rm-53	I have to dodge so many spoilers smh..
rm-53	Nothing else to say, come at me salty ppl lmao

rm-56	Other vegans that youre friends w tell you that they dont tell other ppl theyre vegan?
rm-56	Like the purposefully avoid it.
rm-56	I feel like it fucks over the vegan community cause those are probably the ppl that would be more gentle w their words, which is what some ppl need in order to listen.
rm-56	Im a very straightforward, no sugar coating typa person, and although some ppl appreciate it, a lot more get upset & start trying to put words in my mouth &twisting things.
rm-57	Fellow vegans, does it annoy you when...
rm-58	You honestly deserve to get scammed if you give a random guy on the internet like 300€ worth of fake internet points, like wtf are you doing honestly LOL
rm-59	Why would you give awards to ppl lol
rm-60	Yes i agree things like tumblr made up identities are weird and some people do get offended easily, but if what you said is ignorant/bigoted calling ppl snowflakes is just weak
rm-61	Give your self a pat on your back if you believed and trusted Tom from the start to the end without ANY unsureness and trusted him and never lost hope in the series! Props to you!

rm-63	Dont make it hard urself.
rm-63	The main objective as i understood is to get the dragon. And dont die till that.
rm-63	Even beter if u outfarm ur oponent.
rm-63	Just dont die.
rm-63	And trades in lane...if u see enemy using his escape ability or even damage ability.
rm-64	And I offered to go out to look at Christmas lights but he was out of town
rm-64	so we couldn’t do that- and now he’s back in town and I asked him what he’s doing on New Years and he said he was going to hang out with two of the managers form our work
rm-64	and likeeeee he didn’t offer an invite and then he said if he cancels with them would I like to come over and I just said idk what I’m doing yet so I don’t know
rm-64	Am I overthinking this?
rm-64	Does he not care?
rm-65	There’s gonna be ppl on the internet saying "stat padder" but other than his weird hesitancy to drive, he played pretty solid

rm-67	its chill edgy and if u wanna join commenttt and ill dm u the linkk
rm-68	Just kind of realized that I’ve never had nye plans...
rm-68	I always think about how I haven’t been able to throw birthday parties or shit like that ..
rm-68	recently realized I still don’t have enough friends to have a one for my 21st coming up...
rm-68	Idk why I didn’t clue into This tho.
rm-68	Like I never thought about how ppl have traditions for this night, besides my sister who goes out to her friends every year.
rm-68	It’s funny that covid isn’t affecting my Ny at all..
rm-68	Anyone else in the same boat?
rm-68	Anyway I guess I’ll just watch a movie tonight lol.
rm-69	helo, im looking for ppl to talk to, maybe play some games or watch anime together.
rm-69	just please be aware that im not very good at upholding conversations uwu f/20
rm-70	Like i see vids on yt on it.
rm-70	But like, i cant see any mention on the design notes etc.
rm-70	Where do ppl get the info from?
rm-71	Dm me to debate
rm-71	pls be well learned in your belief.
rm-71	I want dms bc Itll get deep and I cant reply to 300 ppl like that.
rm-71	Also I need 500 characters so here come the blah blah
rm-72	I m not saying that they should be ashamed to be turned into girls or that I m being stereotypical towards a person being a girl but I am saying that they wont like to do it bcoz they r humans with their own choices and not agreeing to be a girl isnt making them a women anti.
rm-72	Like how many guys around you would be willing to turned into disney princesses or to play that butt game?
rm-72	Maybe they get used to this with time [but how much time?]
rm-72	and maybe they know that they have to do all this for the entertainment of fans.
rm-72	but knowing this isn't making anything better for them until they happily and genuinely agree to it.
rm-72	I sometimes feel sad for them when they r asked to do all this.
rm-72	I wont like it if you will try to make me a man and want me to dance in front of so many ppl eventhough I am a tomboy.
rm-73	Anyone missing me?
rm-73	If you miss a reddit friend, read this.
rm-73	IT COULD BE pME!!
rm-74	So I just hopped on PC from Ps4, not even 2.5k games played there,
rm-74	played a few decent games since I frankly suck with a KB&M, and yet for the past week or so I am matching with ppl 2k kills and preds even,
rm-74	yet I haven't even a hundred games played and about 80kills with all characters.
rm-74	Not really having fun anymore,
rm-74	can't improve if I get shit on every game
rm-75	I see a lot of ppl on here who seem hella said, so if u hella sad I’m down to chat.
rm-75	So yeah if u down for a chat, or long term friendship, I’ll be more than happy to do so
rm-76	so i always see ppl talk about sending designs and edits to affinity but how do i do that??
rm-76	ive worked at od for almost a year and none of management has mentioned it??
rm-76	like not even the print sup.
rm-76	we do every type of editing in store and i hate it.
rm-76	like we’re out here doing stuff that im pretty sure is supposed to get sent out to affinity based on what i see on here.
rm-76	but yeah is more of this info on the store portal or where can i learn more?
rm-76	im extremely tired of creating/editing shit for last minute rude customers (:
rm-77	One person in the server was selling the set for 100k and i was like-Hell Nawh That Not Worth 100k- like bruh- .-.
rm-78	WhY dO pPl FiNd ThE NeW SeT ExPeNsIvE
rm-79	Ik the girl I posted abt is a troll ppl- but oh well she got her 6 minutes of fame time to take the posts down
rm-80	HMU with a chat message,
rm-80	tell me about yourself and we can go from there
rm-81	I dont understand how ppl can build what they do...
rm-81	i love building but i guess my creativity isnt well tuned as alotta ppls an it bothers me i cant build amazing stuff
rm-81	i no i could if inhave the creative side uggh
rm-81	i just tend to give up after awhile n settle for simple crap to pass for ok
rm-82	I care abt how I effect ppl a lot but try not to show it.
rm-82	It’s hard for me to join in convos w big groups of ppl which is related to adhd.
rm-82	Sometimes my sensitivity can make me kinda stand offish to ppl idk.
rm-82	I’ll try to act like idc if someone doesn’t like me but drunk ppl will fall to the floor begging them to.
rm-82	These all r adhd things tho bc rsd
rm-82	I’m a good listener. A lot of people view me as really cute or innocent
rm-82	I can have a really really really flirty personality at times.
rm-82	I remember in hs my friends mom said I had the "personality " so I’d probably be the r first to have a boyfriend
rm-83	but when she’s in the wrong or when someone holds HER accountable she just throws the biggest temper tantrum ever and just disrespects any / everyone who doesn’t agree w her and screams about how she doesn’t care
rm-83	or more specifically in her words "I don’t give a fuck"
rm-83	she’ll NEVER take accountability or apologize and becomes the biggest hypocrite
rm-83	all the things she screams @ ppl to NOT do to her she turns around and does the exact same rude petty shit to any/everyone else that doesn’t agree with her
rm-83	I think the main reason she does this is because my sister acts JUST like my mom and my mom can’t stand it / accept that
rm-83	so she becomes down right nasty.
rm-84	In class I’ve usually been really quiet but sometimes I’ll meet someone I click w in class and be reallyyyy really chatty.
rm-84	I think I get along best with girly fun girls, overly confident queen b feisty type people, and just gossipy people.
rm-84	My friends and their families see me as really bubbly and excitable.
rm-84	Although most people see me as sweet, soft spoken, and quiet.
rm-84	Some people think I never talk thought.
rm-84	I’ve always been a smiley happy person though.
rm-84	I do really like making others happy or seeing people I know and having a friendly conversation.
rm-84	I have adhd.
rm-84	Sometimes I’m at a loss for words or boring.
rm-84	I’m really really chatty when drunk.
rm-84	Although sometimes I’m not when drunk which I heard ppl w adhd are both.
rm-85	Could I be istp ?
rm-85	Help type me pls
rm-86	Idk if ppl would even want to
rm-86	just wanna know if thats allowed, and if not where would be a good place to post that
rm-86	(ive watched dragonmar and other ppls videos but that would be hard to be a me specific video on there)
rm-87	like in a good way tho
rm-88	Some ppl are just indescribable
rm-89	I ain’t done this before but i’ve seen enough to get a gist of it so like interests :)
rm-89	we can definitely talk abt anime (especially romance imma sucker for it), we can talk abt games and go into detail abt lore and shtuff, creepy stories go hard, and really i’m just down for anything :)
rm-89	i’m not gonna be weird so as long as you’re not weird
rm-89	any age or anything is fine with me and uh yeah if i didn’t do this right lmk :)
rm-89	oh and i’ll absolutely talk more on snap
rm-90	I mean yeah tbh it is
rm-90	i care abt a lot of ppl and i cant just... make people be happy.
rm-90	But like.... i wanna :(
rm-91	Just wanna make everybody i care about happy,
rm-91	like is that too much to ask
rm-92	I think that some ppl here are ai or something
rm-93	smh don't even try
rm-93	i can do that by myself🤠
rm-94	Hey, F/19 , bored af ,
rm-94	I enjoy talking to new ppl,
rm-94	hmu?!
rm-95	i started chatting with her and a co-worker of hers who was in high school in the late 90s.
rm-95	she said everyone was watching wrestling back then and it was a cool thing.
rm-95	now no one gives a shit😭 (i don’t rlly blame them sometimes).
rm-95	i asked her "why do u think ppl stopped liking it" and she said "cause it’s garbage.
rm-95	it’s come on fox on fridays and as soon as 7 o’clock hit i change the channel"
rm-95	i had to include that in there bc she’s so funny😂😂😂
rm-95	anyways.
rm-96	Hey, Cant fall asleep and this platform seems pretty interesting,
rm-96	hmu if u think we could hit off well,
rm-96	hope we have a great time ,future chat buddy ;)😁
rm-97	kinda weird ngl
rm-98	These mfs can outrun, out swim or out stam (through venom) anything that tries to get it.
rm-98	Mine is literally covered in scars head to toe from escaped or successful fights.
rm-99	just finished the show so i’m a lil behind everyone but equally obsessed and want to talk about it so much lol.
rm-99	also by sidestory i mean something that’s not part of the main plot!
rm-100	One of the best game ever that I play!
rm-100	But have some probs..
rm-101	I’d always heard of mac for years but never really checked him out in detail until a couple months ago and now he’s one of my favorite and most often listened to artists rn.
rm-101	Anyways that was just my thoughts,
rm-101	Happy new years everyone
rm-101	hope the new year treats u well.
rm-102	Now for this one it's kinda hard because the enemies are SOOO COOL for this game, but... If I had to choose, I'd say I like the Clown the most.
rm-102	I just think their design and movement is super neat.
rm-102	Plus they are one of the few if not THE only enemie in the game that doesn't have a single other Variation from what I remember.
rm-103	Honestly I wasn't gonna make one but I want to at least give my two cents especially since I dsagree with a lot of others list,
rm-103	not to say my list is right bc this is all subjective anyway which Is why I hate making them.
rm-104	Here we go again, another character fighting tier list!
rm-104	YAYYYY
rm-105	Imo lily for the most part is a rather likeable character (keep in mind ive only played a bit of season 1 up to like part of ep 3)
rm-105	unlike her father lily tries to work with lee and for the most part the group
rm-105	she does what she has to
rm-105	she is a bit of a bitch cause she has to
rm-105	i only have 1 problem with lily
rm-105	she killed carly
rm-105	if you could get ben to confess
rm-105	yes i got spoiled on that and a few other things
rm-105	ben is useless
rm-105	he is what looks like a collage student yet he is useless and needs rescuing 24/7
rm-105	pls dont downvote me into oblivion if i missed something
rm-106	I pretty much just use it for drums and I like making complex beats
rm-106	so 4 isn't really cutting it anymore and piano roll editing drums kinda sucks IMO.
rm-106	Is there a way to make the step sequencer into 8th or 16th notes in FL?
rm-107	I’m not a trans man, but I am interested in knowing someone’s perspectives who lived both as a woman and as a man
rm-107	(not a lot of people get to experience what it is like to be perceived as both genders)
rm-107	so thats kinda neat imo
rm-108	I don't think he did the role justice.
rm-108	I feel before neo figured it out the way he was speaking was ok, but after...IMO he should of went full Hugo weaving speech.
rm-109	Just wanted to share my opinion not being a united fan, on the game against burnley.
rm-109	(not that many of you will care).
rm-109	Mctominay sheeeeesh what a guy.
rm-109	Thought that shaw was solid,
rm-109	now youve got two good left backs in good form.
rm-109	Also wanted to say awb had a muhc better game i thought.
rm-109	AFter the shitty games and dalot playing well I personaly thought awb improved alot.
rm-110	I would be fine if it was changed to tome can ONLY drop at 4-6,
rm-110	yes this also ties into the item drop timing issues but for me I can live with those issues but not this,
rm-110	pls change
rm-111	Kind of an odd question imo, but I have a bp who I just got to eat f/t for the first time (yay!!!), but she seems to prefer medium rats.
rm-111	I've tried f/t large rats with no success.
rm-111	First medium I offer and I got her to eat.
rm-111	Could be a fluke though.
rm-112	Ik it's like a meme or something of "dark souls player complains about the combat" or something similar, but I just don't get the combat.
rm-112	I can do ds3 deathless, I know how to parry at about above average skill, I have played a shit ton of Ghost of Tsushima lately,
rm-112	ik not a difficult game but hear me out rq if you know the game.
rm-113	OMG!
rm-113	WHY do so many morons try to download PC game torrents when firstly they dont have ANY idea of how a torrent even works (its so damn easy though!)
rm-113	comments like "The link doesnt work" Rofl!
rm-113	Yes, it works completely fine!
rm-113	Your just way too dumb to know you need a torrent program.
rm-114	😤Idiot morons 😡😡🤬
rm-115	So i get tipped on the app, gave me cash at the door, then took away the tip on the app after?
rm-115	Wtf is even the point of that?
rm-115	This shit has never happened before but now it’s happened 3 times this week.
rm-115	Once the cash tip was LESS than the app tip...
rm-115	If your are tipping both, TIP BOTH.
rm-116	Ngl tft is a good mode ,but its like hs a good game to play on your phone not something to grind out all day all night like wtf ?
rm-116	Its not even that engaging (ideal game to turn on prep up and alt tab until its next time u can do anyhing)
rm-116	any thoughts?
rm-117	i know its a scientific things and all but some of the post there is just too much.
rm-117	learning dream languages???
rm-117	wtf?
rm-117	and some bloke is saying "i tried the 3 jump and eat banana method but didnt lucid dream?!" every few hours.
rm-117	maybe the post are just giving a litte too imaginative?
rm-118	Like everyone is gathered and shows fake smile, fake dance, fake love and I am like Dear lord wtf is happening ooooh
rm-119	So I am I first time cup user and i got the saalt cup at target.
rm-119	I decided to do a dry run in the shower today and it went in pretty fine after a few different fold methods were attempted (C-fold+17yovirgin=ow)
rm-119	I got in in w/the 7 fold and it may not have been perfect but a great first try.
rm-119	I go to take it out and how tf am i supposed to do this with my long ass acrylic nails.
rm-119	In one way, it kind of helped me ~find~ the cup lowkey grip but god damn was it difficult trying not to stab myself.
rm-120	Didn’t think about nails...
rm-121	Is he gonna tell her?
rm-121	If so how would that convo go down?!!!?
rm-122	Okay wtf Arlo now knows sera ( idk how to spell her full name) is Johns weakness
rm-123	First of all, we've seen they are greedy as f(OK, not as other mobile studios, but stiiiiiill)
rm-123	Second, game needs a lot of work to work well (even if it was designed for high end phones)
rm-123	Even that (oh, Allah may forgive me) damn Fornite mobile is better optimized nowadays.
rm-124	Wtf are you yanks on
rm-125	See also:
rm-125	(on an article about how it's "40 degrees in some parts of Europe")
rm-125	> wtf lol that's not hot at all
rm-125	put on a jakcet dummies
rm-125	("[city] experiences average annual temperatures of 16C")
rm-125	> zomg thats rly cold
rm-125	im never moving to canada
rm-126	Someines it will cause me to have racing thoughts, others it chills me tf out and gives me nods similar to codiene,
rm-126	why the hell is this?
rm-126	I think it has something to do with wether or not a woman looks at me and thinks Im ugly,
rm-126	if that happens I get anxious From it,
rm-126	but ifva women looks at me and feels indifferent and even thinks im decent looking, I get good effects from the stuff.
rm-126	WTF IS GOING ON
rm-127	If you shoot an enemy then crouch to become invisble, even if they don't detect you they will waltz right over to exactly where you are.
rm-127	Sneak is garbage in this game.
rm-127	I shouldve just grabbed an smg and power armor.
rm-128	I finally beat him after so many trys most of them being on his second phase,
rm-128	his 3rd phase I beat first time.
rm-129	I got 7 place on last event with Magaki but have 2960 points and get 50 frags instead 80 for 7-10 place.
rm-129	Why?
rm-129	Becuz i have less than 3000 points.
rm-129	(i need 55 magaki frags and i get 50, just feel my suffering)
rm-129	Also in other event with gamer764 i have \~8000 points and got 4 place and got rewards for 4 place, not for 1,
rm-129	whats need 7k points or more.
rm-129	Are the developers too greedy?
rm-130	I made plans to go camping during a day we were goin to see each other and I got a bunch of texts on how she wished I was still free Wednesday and so I canceled it and now she won't stop saying sorry that's not what she meant.
rm-130	Wtf do I do
rm-130	I told her I was going on another one next month(lie) to make her feel better but I didn't.
rm-131	But, I don't neccesarily need top of the line if that also means the light will be heavy and bulky.
rm-131	I prefer high speed, low drag equipment.
rm-131	Would prefer to use AA batteries rather than being tethered to 16850s.
rm-131	Can you recommend something?
rm-131	Thanks
rm-132	Okay so I've got less than a chapter left in GotM and I still can't understand wtf Oponn is trying to achieve through all their/its meddling.
rm-132	Is there something I'm missing, is it continued in another book, or is it just a dead end?
rm-133	It actually got like 7 updoots
rm-133	Yhall are whack
rm-134	Wtf i posted a litteral anime foot and still didn't even make most controversial post of DAY. let alone all time
rm-135	So huh you cant alpha karthus ult
rm-135	wtf is this bs?
rm-136	It would be very helpful all of you OP's out there actually said wtf it was that everyone is talking about before going on a banter about it!
rm-136	Such as "now I understand why this (brand name) thing has everyone going crazy"...
rm-136	To someone that is not constantly in the loop about the different changes, that doesn't mean much to me.
rm-136	If it's too long to type, reference the original post, news article, video, whatever that the beginning of your post.
rm-137	And the scary thing, I am not in the "DFW teams are cursed" camp or a #FireJD type.
rm-137	However, some of this stuff is bugging me to much.
rm-137	When Corey Perry being signed by the Stars is not the biggest potential WTF transaction among DFW teams, that is a bad sign.
rm-138	I’m building a pc but in the mean time I use a crappy 13 year old pc
rm-138	I got money for rust bought it and it took 4 hours to download 1 hour to load and 5 hours to load a server

rm-139	EM: GT just wanted smores and to find treasure.
rm-139	GK pulls out one of the treasures from his backpack.
rm-139	My GF faces just turned red because the treasure he found was her dildo.
rm-139	GF snatches that out of GT hand.
rm-139	GF: This isn't meant for kids.
rm-139	GT: But its mine I found it and finders keepers.

rm-140	Me damn is not a cuss word
rm-141	She left for another dude (a player), has strung me along this whole time pretty much and been hot n cold.
rm-141	Now shes onto another guy as of the end of March and is currently on vacation with him for 9 days in another state
rm-141	However, she takes the same bike trail as me (the only one) for the past few months and we run into each other every couple weeks and have small talk.
rm-141	About a week and a half ago we talked for well over an hour on the trail.
rm-141	Kind if disrespectful to the new bf huh?
rm-141	We get along and she told me happy birthday on May 3rd,
rm-141	however, i will not be wishing her one today.
rm-141	Birthdays are a big deal to her but i cant think of a reason why i should…
rm-142	After going "uhh no?" She sends me a picture of said candle holder.From her kitchen.
rm-142	I of course go "wtf you're home??" and turns out she left an hour ago from the hospital.
rm-142	No updates.
rm-142	No phonecall.
rm-142	So Im beyond pissed that I was even concerned for three days.
rm-142	Tldr: sickly nmom went into hospital for 3 days,
rm-142	I find out shes home because of a candle holder.
rm-143	ts been a few years and i dont care to look back so long as we can be happy together but its really hard for her.
rm-143	The thing that hurts her the most is i let her go through my phone after finding the nudes and there was a message i sent to someone on Facebook in response to her calling me beautiful bc of a song i made that i was sharing.
rm-143	I was very flirtatious maybe more so than i was with my gf when i was first talking to her and that has been choing in my gfs mind.
rm-143	Its been extremely difficult for her
rm-143	we have two dogs now
rm-143	i was hoping us having two pups to love would help draw her back to being in love with me again bc we have them to bond over but she still cant say "i love you too"
rm-143	she doesnt accept when i try to give her compliments bc ive said rude things in the past when i use to drink (2 years ago).
rm-144	You can try fancy elaborate games but if you stink and dress like shit, best of luck to you but i dont see it happening.
rm-144	Working as a waiter has definitely forced me to up my grooming by trumming my nails, wearing versace crystal noir and ither fragrances etc. Which i believe is the reason why most girls even if theyre taken at least are willing to have a convo with me.
rm-144	Rejection is the ultimate tool for self development and even though ive been shot down by countless numbers of women in my life, i never let it get me down and im so proud of myself for even having the confidence to speak to these women even though i may not have hollywood good looks or charidma like will smith xD.
rm-144	You guys are all beautiful and i wish you all the best of success with finding your companions :)
rm-145	Shes 18 inches long & weighs 56 grams at 15 months.
rm-145	Just curious if this is a pretty average growth rate for females or is she growing really fast?
rm-145	She eats like an absolute champ every 4-5 days and shes already longer than some males get so I'm curious!
rm-146	the anime is about an mc thats in a game but she doesnt realise it but the system says shes dead and etc
rm-146	i would like to wath the rest of it soo plz help me.
rm-147	Lookking for a anime
rm-148	Idk if to others its strange, but to me it was.
rm-148	I got covid by kissing another guy for the first time, so i had to tell my mum.
rm-148	I couldve just lied and say it was cuz of sharing cups or kissing a girl since in BI, but i knew my parents would be accepting...
rm-148	so i told them as it was.
rm-148	My mum was VERY dissapointed because she thought she new me well, and though i told her everything but now she couldnt trust me anymore cuz bla bla bla...
rm-148	basically he was very dissapointed in me, and actually took time to convince her that i didnt feel like telling her because its private to me... till today
rm-148	she doesnt really trust me like before, but shes ok lol.
rm-149	Today its my birthday so im sharing my ''strange'' comming out story
rm-150	So me and my friend started playing val again and want us to learn comms such as heaven and all of that,
rm-150	now I know what heaven is but I don't know others and if there is a website I would be happy to have to look at it :D
rm-150	(If your still confused ill give a scenario "I hit the jett, shes in heaven" like the location.
rm-151	Shes an awesome cook does all the grocery shopping.
rm-151	My aunt and I will be helping out too, but shes not a good cook either LOL.
rm-151	So I want to make their lives easier by meal prepping, and to make sure my mom is eating well
rm-151	she cant be eating junk recovering!
rm-152	(I got this a lot where a girl gets hired and I have to help them, they are always rude to me for no reason, unless the woman is older or its a guy)
rm-152	She's all nice and sweet to everyone else but she's just rude to me.
rm-152	She will take credit from me and blame me when stuff goes wrong(not to my face).
rm-152	The moment she is around guys and other people, she belittles me.
rm-152	She talks good about herself, takes my credit then blames me when something goes wrong and everyone in my department goes along with it. Which is wrong,
rm-152	when she is there she doesn't do any work and clowns around with the guys but only when the managers aren't there.
rm-152	The worst part about it is people really like her and think me and her are close friends.
rm-153	The "false advertising" on thr A4 passive is very easy to understand if you just read the whole skill were it says multiple buffs cant co exist.
rm-153	Maybe im the only one but i think this is all dumb and alsp kills a lot of peoples excitement.
rm-153	I dont like to hear people freaking out for no reason over a five star lol.
rm-153	Its just like zhongli.
rm-153	He was fine but everyone freaked because he wasnt doing enough to dumster content and was balanced.
rm-154	Ive seen lots of ppl in the fandom make rude/racist comments about liberty and its disgusting
rm-154	please leave her alone.
rm-154	And you do realize shes black?
rm-154	stop making fun of the actors ethnic features
rm-154	its honestly rude and not cute.
rm-154	There is nothing wrong with her lips or having big lips in general
rm-154	its not even funny
rm-154	honestly its just sick and not cool to behave like that.
rm-154	And its not even just liberty I've seen people talk about Sav and also Jimmys hair.
rm-154	(also mods please dont take this down
rm-154	I really want people to see it and I have done nothing wrong
rm-154	I've been having some of my post randomly deleted for no reason)
rm-155	( As simple as removing the salad and remaking it without guac.)
rm-155	She then told me we gave her less meat when I brought back THE SAME PLATE sans guac.
rm-156	SHES HOME FOR THE FIRST TIMEE
rm-157	SHESS FINNALLY BACKK
rm-158	I am making this because of one reason only.
rm-158	I have to keep my pup im her crate at night bc if i dont she will poop on the floor.
rm-158	So theres already 6-8 hours of her being inactive.
rm-158	Then i have work - which is again 6-8 hours.
rm-158	I have to keep my corgi in my bathroom at this time because if i dont she will reek havoc unsupervised.
rm-159	AITA for starting a fight with an old friend (Strong Swearing)
rm-160	So me and my crush were on a group chat on snapchat with my friend,
rm-160	me and my friend were arguing as a "joke" and then she said she prefered older guys, and my friend was (M14) and i said im a year older than you, and she says "what i mean by older guys i mean age 17" and it hurt my heart.
rm-160	TLDR; my crush says she prefers dudes who are 17 years old and im 16 and shes 15 and it broke me down.
rm-161	Hello I am new on here but idk if I am the butthole or entitled one this story,
rm-161	this is short but I was expecting to get a tat for my 18 bday like any 18 year old but I wanted to go to this one shop that my brother goes to
rm-161	I dm the artist I wanted but nothing for 2 months
rm-161	like yea I understand they booked for summer tats but at least say "hey I am booked for the rest of ____"
rm-161	but I was like ok will I am gonna look at another artist work from this shop that does small tats
rm-161	same thing happens no answer
rm-161	so me and my brother decides "ok let's go to the shop and ask then we well at least get a answer"
rm-161	we go and this young girl attends us lets call her (brenda)
rm-161	I told her everything,
rm-161	brenda said "well u can do the tat with me"
rm-161	I said "I'll be back i'll think about it"
rm-161	I got back in the car and scroll through her work
rm-161	it was good work so I went back and told her yea let's do this
rm-161	I signed everything
rm-161	she didn't even ask for ID which I found weird bc I gotten my piercings done by the same shop and they needed to have ID on records and so on
rm-161	I brushed it off since shes new and all
rm-161	she worked on me for a hour told me all the necessary tattoo care stuff and said after 3 or 4 weeks to let her know if there need to be fixes and that it was on her
rm-161	I was like ok great thanks,
rm-161	4 weeks passed and there was alot of mistakes made bc I got a small tat heartbeat with a ";" in the middle but the period on top was a small heart
rm-161	the right side of the heart was smaller then the other side and some of the lines were thick to thin then broke to thick again
rm-162	So I reset it and yeah oops was doing it wrong all this time.
rm-162	Did anyone else kick it away and get mad it wasn't dying?
rm-163	Then afterwards she began to text very dry ? and like through text she kinda sounded mad.
rm-163	I texted her in the night yesterday asking if shes mad and like she said shes only abit let down ?
rm-163	I was really confused afterwards as she began to drag text me and like i apologized to her and she said its alright .
rm-163	Then i just told her im going to sleep and she just left my message on delivered and like she didnt reply to today.
rm-164	How to tell whether she's mad at me or just annoyed cuz rn im really confused
rm-165	WIBTA if I was just be a bigger sarcastic Asshole to another Asshole?
rm-166	Her tumors are behinning to open through her skin, she wont jump, pain killers dont help, she ate a lot yesterday but wont eat or drink today, she hid most the day but..... Its hard because shes alert.
rm-166	It feels wrong because she looks at me like "i love you.
rm-166	Im happy your here with me"
rm-166	but the vet said she wasnt even supposed to live this long and the tumors will only get worse and even if we had done chemo, it would have only prolonged it.
rm-167	friend told my girlfriend something,
rm-167	she then broke up with me,
rm-167	i dont know what to now because she and the ex friend where the only people that i had.
rm-167	what should i do to try and regain my relationship because shes helped me through alot over our 2 years of dating
rm-167	TLDR gf broke up with me bc something someone said and i want to regain relationship with my gf
rm-168	He waited for me to leave to fire someone who has been a dedicated employee bc shes a poc with tattoos and"fits the part" of someone he considered would be on drugs.
rm-168	It makes me sick.
rm-168	I reported all this high up bc I need to protect my staff but I’m worried that this will turn around and bite me.
rm-169	My ex looooves kids.
rm-169	She was playing captain save a hoe, almost caught a domestic case over this woman's situation with this girl's "crazy" baby daddy.
rm-169	They moved fast.
rm-169	They were in eachothers life.
rm-169	it hasn't even been two months!!!
rm-169	IM SO HURT.
rm-169	SHE NEVER WANTED TO BUILD A LIFE WITH ME.
rm-169	I KNEWWWWW she would be all in if I had a kid on me.
rm-170	Theyve grown out to the point they look kinda awkward and shes saying i should get them filled, but would it be weird or bad (like for my nails) or anything to ask about getting them completely redone with something Id like better?
rm-171	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
rm-171	SHE SAID SHE MIGHT HAVE SOME CLOTHES THAT FIT ME
rm-171	IM DYINGGGG
rm-171	SHES SO SUPPORTIVE AND NICEE OMGGG
rm-172	So its 0:34 the first of January while posting this and my Sister (f14) just Ruined my New Year by Calling my Mum Fat and telling her shes a drinker when she Poured herself a glass of champagne, wich she only does on her Birthday on chrismas eve and on New year.
rm-172	Now my Parents are pissed of, my grandparents are pissed off and my Sister thinks she was Funny.
rm-172	The same thing happend on Chrismas eve and now the whole feeling of new year is gone and i hate my sister.
rm-172	P.S. English is my second language so sry for spelling
rm-173	Screw INTJ’s.
rm-173	Why they gotta be good at EVERYTHING?!
rm-174	It was a MISTAKE getting the booster the day before new years.
rm-174	I feel like absolute dog water.
rm-175	literally most of today we spent cuddling and talking about random shit and i almost cried🙏
rm-175	im so happy bro.
rm-175	shes so cool.
rm-175	im gonna ask her to be my girlfriend at midnight :)
rm-175	also, happy nye/happy ny everyone!!
rm-176	first of all, the satisfaction i get from saying i am the manager when customers ask for one is amazing.
rm-176	a high i’ll never come off of.
rm-176	second of all, customer comes in for the second time mad because i didnt do copies from a book because of copyright.
rm-176	she goes "well i called customer service and they said you were not supposed to reject me like that".
rm-176	and im like ?? ma’am its in our policy
rm-176	idc what customer service says.
rm-176	she keeps on being rude and yapping then throws the book on the counter and goes "make my copy"
rm-176	like lol not when you act rude like that.
rm-177	our cat is getting fixed on the 11th, and shes such a cuddly, loving, little girl and i love her cuddles every night and in the morning
rm-177	im just scared that she isnt gonna be like that after she gets fixed?
rm-177	am i over thinking it?
rm-177	do you think since shes in the habit now and loves cuddles and such she'll do it all her life?
rm-178	Me and my partner have this running joke that I domt fart.
rm-178	It started out as a joke after I told her that as an answer to a truth or dare question on our first date.
rm-178	Recently shes been asking me if i'll fart infront of her.
rm-178	She says her friends have all heard their partners fart and its weirf shes never heard me do it.
rm-179	I can't believe she saying im depressed looking while shes so shy girl and weird thinking she's not,
rm-179	so delusional
rm-179	i hate it,but they are mine only friends,
rm-179	she calling me cringe without a reason...
rm-180	Mine friends are mean and delusional,
rm-180	one is immiture and shy and always pulling me down,
rm-180	other is fine just jealous and its getting on my nerves,
rm-180	what to do?
rm-181	This is a set up I can live with.
rm-181	My bf and my's fear however is in a few years when we're ready to settle down, Gina will be wanting to move in and be long term with her own bf.
rm-181	I'm very stuck.
rm-181	I love my boyfriend and desperately want to keep his system happy.
rm-181	But I am not going to allow anymore pushing of the boundries.
rm-181	What do I do here?
rm-182	Boundry Issues w/ my boyfriends alter
rm-183	She was super keen for a second date and we arranged a location but not a date, due to the Christmas holidays.
rm-183	I appreciate it’s a busy period for people, so our responses were like 1 per day.
rm-183	She was upfront when we met and said shes sh** at texting, and has apologies when we were speaking for slow replies, something which I said don’t worry, I know your busy!
rm-183	Convo seems to flow well, lots of questions from her side in the conversation,
rm-183	however I’ve not received a response for 3 days (unread) but she’s viewed my story & posted a story since,
rm-183	it was NYE.
rm-184	So i was all ready for the new year actually thinking positive and the changes im going to make etc
rm-184	then i see hes posted a picture of them both that shes took saying 'love of my life'.
rm-184	It destroyed me.
rm-184	He also put a status about 2022 being a special one.
rm-184	Talk about rubbing it in my face
rm-185	Exes bf posted a pic of them :(
rm-186	Everytime i ask other people for advice on this situation, they all tell me that she’s probably insecure and looks up to me (even tho shes older wtf) and that i shouldn’t blame her for the way she feels.
rm-186	I cannot deal with her,
rm-186	she drains the life out of me,
rm-186	I cannot talk about anything without her either trying to copy me or compete with me.
rm-186	Recently ive been losing weight, and our family members noticed and commented on it.
rm-186	In the corner of my eye, i could see her getting uncomfortable and then obviously she brang herself up and started talking about her accomplishments.
rm-187	We agree to seperate as our marriage was hitting a nose dive in general.
rm-187	2 months later we get back together.
rm-187	We do intensive therapy and things seem to be great
rm-187	im sooooo happy.
rm-187	On our anniversary month wat do i see on his phone snapchat.
rm-187	I look on it again i see jane but this time i can look at there conversation history throughout this whole year and last.
rm-188	So i just got my first beardie.
rm-188	Hes only a moth old and like most new owners im worried about if hes or she is not eating enough.
rm-188	I try to feed him in periods throughout the day but so far ive only been able to feed about 6-7 crickets .
rm-188	Ive tried feeding him some vegies too but the guy doesnt show any interest in them.
rm-188	Is there anything Im doing wrong or is he just fine and im overly worried.
rm-189	Then I foundout about this really cool website called Complex.
rm-189	Theyre sort of like journalism but better since theyre all about hip hop.
rm-189	I found out about Travis Scott through complex.
rm-189	before I listened to trash artists with no aesthetic but travis scott made me realize that aesthetic is really important.
rm-189	now i like tame impala and ive started dressing weirder, i bought my first pair of joggers last week and hopefully ill wear them soon.
rm-190	is it just me cringing at the twitter posts by albatross?
rm-190	everyone who knows who he is knows his stance.
rm-190	hes making it seem like xvg is a sinking ship atm and its doing fine.
rm-191	soo i have this friend IRL.
rm-191	man the dude is known everywhere.
rm-191	hes got a solid rep in the streets, in the jails, everywhere this guy goes everyone knows him.
rm-191	he was trying to explain to me how to get more karma on reddit because i feel like i'm not really known.
rm-192	how do you get hella karma?
rm-193	Im 21 hes about to be 23,
rm-193	my issue is that he seens to have no ambition anymore,
rm-193	he doesnt work and doesnt make an effort to finish school, even small trade schools for a certification as an emt,
rm-193	he failed it the first time by 2 points and I think he fears failure that he doesnt really want to try anything anymore.
rm-193	Hes been unemployed for over a year now and failed that school almost a year ago.
rm-194	Ive gotten super smough about 5 times but i always get stuck in his nuclear butt bomb aura.
rm-194	I swear im far enough away but it still shocks me in 1 hit.
rm-194	Im using 2H battle axe +10gargoyle helm and naked (even with tattered armor it doesnt seem to make a difference)Chloranthy ring and ring of steel protection.
rm-194	Any tips?
rm-194	I know throwing myself at them enough times ill get them but its slowly wearing at my sanity.
rm-194	I know what to do but i seem to always get caught in a dumb combo or something.
rm-195	I bet you didn’t bother reading the whole number, or noticed the letter I put in there, annnd now you’ll go back to check only to realize there was no letter.
rm-195	What I if also told you, you read this sentence wrong too?
rm-195	*WELL NOW THAT I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION*
rm-195	I hope you’ll carefully read through the rest of this post :^)
rm-196	19/F Aww shit, here we go again for the 7754378435116th time
rm-197	If I just wana make draven my 1 carry how should i do it.
rm-197	I know hes a good unit but what items can turn him into a god.
rm-197	I tried heali g sword n rfc but i get lost after that.
rm-198	Atlus is a great character
rm-198	however his shield is gun is op and his rewind ability is somewhat annoying.
rm-198	However the most annoying thing is his shield.
rm-198	If you place down the shield and just use it to stop bullets thats fine.
rm-198	However I was playing as Skye today and threw my ult at his shield.
rm-198	It did not activate because it got absorbed.
rm-198	Idk about other players oppinions but I believe that Atlus should be nerfed a good bit so hes not op evough to counter everything.
rm-198	Tell me what you ppl think
rm-199	I didn't think anything of it so when I went to give the last cookies on the shelf to him the EK started screaming "MOOOOOMMYYYYYY HE STOOOOLE MY COOOOOOKIES!!!"
rm-199	At first I was startled
rm-199	i started to get nervous and i froze.
rm-199	Then EP walks up and starts yelling "GIVE THOSE COOKIES FROM MY DAUGHTER GIVE THEM BACK!!"
rm-199	And I did not know what to say at first but then something came so mind just say " but I didnt."
rm-199	But the way I said was so cautious.
rm-199	Then my sister takes the cookies from my hands and handed them to my dad.
rm-199	That's when my dad noticed (hes old sad he didn't realise a little bit ealier)
rm-199	he called a manager to the seen and the manager told us to continue and he'll deal with it.
rm-200	We broke up 2 months ago.
rm-200	We had very little contact.
rm-200	But tmrw im no longer putting up with it.
rm-200	He would be the one to reach put all the time.
rm-200	I never reached out first.
rm-200	And if I answered it was only about the class he was paying me to do.
rm-200	He is still on my car insurance and he messaged me on friend asking what was going on with it.
rm-200	I answered the next day and said i didnt change anything.
rm-200	After that part of the convo ended i asked him how he was doing about the death of his dog.
rm-200	(He is deployed and his dog was his world)
rm-200	he said that hes good when he doesnt think about it and how he told his mom to cremate him etc.
rm-201	Day 1 of no contant starts tmrw.
rm-201	Help.
rm-202	So me and a friend ended up making a poster
rm-202	we used my name and ill credit his Instagram below
rm-202	hes a good guy
rm-202	im glad we got both our ideas in the poster for the game and or story
rm-202	would you guys like either home made lore or not?
rm-202	i could=t post this on the fallout Reddit for some reason,
rm-202	wouldn't let me put the photo
rm-202	hope its good guys!
rm-203	is it even possible for itsoktocry to blow up outside of the 3 songs hes had do extremly well?
rm-203	Like get burst into the mainstream rather than just have a few albums do well then fall off?
rm-204	Me and my friend have been playing Minecraft together for awhile and they made their own server so we can play on it together alone, cool.
rm-204	I have always told my friend how much i despises griefers because they dont just destroy something in a game they destroy HOURS of work and it fucking sucks.
rm-204	My friend lately has been really mean to me when we are playing, constantly saying im mean if i dont go half way across the map to give him material that can be easily obtained where he is, literally repeating to me non stop how im 'mean' or a 'bad person' because im busy doing something so i cant go give him his shit.
rm-205	Well I finally get a chance to let loose and have a wine date with a childhood friend of mine that I dont see often at all.
rm-205	We drink (at my house) while the kids are playing and such.
rm-205	Nothing heavy,
rm-205	we do get slightly tipsy ya know.
rm-205	Towards the end, my husband sends me a fb message saying hes ready for her to leave (she'd been there 2 hrs at this point) and then he starts passive aggressive cleaning in front of us.
rm-206	Hes going through a divorce so he keeps telling me thats taking all his money.
rm-206	I didnt give him a title as I didnt even get one when i bought it.
rm-206	It was salvage from some guys as a used car lot.
rm-206	They gave me a bill of sale but I've long since lost it.
rm-206	Should take him to court or do y'all think its not worth it?
rm-206	Also if I did want to how would i?
rm-207	So I just told this guy in my class who was also weird af and gave it to him saying oof I sat on jt it broke do u just want it.
rm-207	Hes like no ew.
rm-207	I have ocd and immediately got ashamed and was like lol whys it gross
rm-207	it's the same as a whole one and along that line like lol why and he was like ok oof it's not and I'm like lol why did you say that.
rm-207	I was saying it jokingly but I'm afraid I looked weird
rm-207	like wtf
rm-207	whys she upset or playfully upset that I dont want it.

rm-210	Its not tht i am trying to promote this app or something,
rm-210	it really helped me a lot
rm-210	thts why thought it might evn help u gyz out .
rm-210	I 've seen quite a lot of people struggling to increase their team ovr's and many are thinking to buy players but cant decide which will boost their team ovr's the most .
rm-210	This app helps to calculate the ovr of ur team after filling all the players in their respective positions.
rm-210	It is really tough for most people(f2p players) to keep on buying and selling players to decide our team ovr since it will result in a huge loss of coins(coz of 10% EA tax).

rm-227	This was received rather poorly, earning me some disapproving comments.
rm-228	Arent u all tired of seeing atleast the first two jumping into battle and wiping out ur whole team in an instant?
rm-228	I’ve heard somewhere about people saying if they werent here then well the game would be balanced,
rm-228	well i beg to differ cos theres akai with his insane disruption and diggie with his timely ulti or maybe even irithel might be banned cos of her deadly ability to snowball and splash ult.
rm-228	Back to the topic.
rm-228	Honestly the king and queen of this game is lancelot and his beloved fanny.
rm-229	Yoo know, to keep it safe from me in little car where I can go anywhere.
rm-229	And then Mom-O desidez to go to gym to do kwik workout, whatever dat iz.
rm-229	She sez to me, "Yoo leave steak alone, doggo. Yoo be gud gurl!"
rm-229	She tied plastik bag reel tite around steak.

rm-229	Then she goes into gym and when she comez bak many furevers later, GUESS WHAT??
rm-229	Hahahaha!
rm-229	She open tiny car and look at me and look at steak bag....and she say, "GUD GURL!!!
rm-229	Yoo leeve steak alone!"
rm-229	And dat is da storee of me bein' gud gurl.
rm-229	Mom-O sez she shud have brought steak into gym and left on bench next to her wiff her sweatshirt.
rm-229	Sez she dum not to think of dat.
rm-229	Mebbe Mom-O will git smart in a few furevers.
rm-230	My bed smells like disease

rm-231	Pls send me some tips n stuff on what to teach him.
rm-231	Currently hes doing pretty good, though the only thing he buys is shotguns because thats the only gun he gets kills from.

rm-232	Or shud i give them another chance?
rm-232	Or maybe i am just wierd lol

rm-235	Aita , me (31f) asked my kids dad (43m)to help me finish off stripping wallpaper in kids room so I can finish decorating it.
rm-235	I recently had surgery and am not ment to lift too much or stretch but felt OK n thought I could do it alone .
rm-235	I can't,
rm-235	I hurt my incisions so asked him to help do the top of walls were I can't reach .
rm-235	He said yes n today came to do it ,
rm-235	after a bit said he was done and leaving,
rm-235	I gave him £20 n said how greatful I am for the help .
rm-235	Checked room once he left ...
rm-235	both kids beds full of torn off we wallpaper , draws cracked where he stood on ,
rm-235	iv still 2 walls left unfinished and have spent last 45 min picking up wallpaper from everything.
rm-235	His kids sleep on these beds ,
rm-235	aita if I confront him about the mess or shud I let it go n not bother asking in future
rm-236	my boyfriend gets impatient easily and gets annoyed when i ask dumb questions (example, i didnt know how to fill my tire and he got annoyed after he explained it once and then said "why is it hard….. just fill it"
rm-236	so i tried to do it but i failed.
rm-236	later he was like "babe… it took you an hour to fill your tire?"
rm-236	then when i do it myself and dont ask him he goes "why dont you ask me, i can teach you/help you" but i refrain from asking becuz he gets frustrated
rm-237	The last couple calls had arguments as he got mad cuz I beat his ass in video games (even tho gaming is his only hobby) and I’ve left wondering if our relationship is worth the trouble.
rm-237	I’ve talked abt him to lots of my irl friends and they all ask why I continue to be his friend and I can never confidently answer why.
rm-237	But he’s depressed and lonely and wants my attention as I’m one of the only ppl who actively tries to interact w him online.
rm-238	yeah Ik shoes don't match.
rm-238	they match the graffiti tho !
rm-238	I'm trying alot of different styles so lmk what I shud change
rm-238	hat: sicko by Ian conner

rm-239	ok so i swallowed a small piece of box(?) tape as i was trying to bite it off w my teeth n then i feel it in my ear😭 not ear but tht hole in my throat tht leads to the ear its jus stuck there omg😭😭😭
rm-239	what shud i do lol
rm-240	She had me live with a woman once named Chi who said similar stuff , and … it’s just dude wt… heck it’s weird ,
rm-240	so maybe it’s BOTH sort of a paradox (life is) but I just wanna know Hinestly did anyone else feel it ?
rm-240	I want a logical explanation Plz , n if one don’t exist well I mean cuz loooong before … I was "of age" so to speak … for lack of more efficient words that would be appropriate cuz I don’t drink but I’ve … hmm I’m an adult let’s put it like that
rm-240	there’s other stjfff out there but Long before thag me and myFamily saw a UFO
rm-240	even mg step dad said he couldn’t think of what else it could’ve been and me and my friends saw this white hooded thing in a park about 10 feet tall n like … it doesn’t really scare me cuz I think it’s the way life is
rm-240	things change
rm-240	they don’t always have to make sense , and others say that 2.
rm-241	Here is an example of two paragraphs written in the alternate spelling system and then in regular spelling:

rm-265	Hi,I was wondering wheter or not it worths to drop some money on pets.
rm-265	Like I saw how much some ppl can spend on them to get good results (like t4), and I wouldnt want to spend that much :D.
rm-265	Currently I have 5 t1 pets, and I wouldnt mind to see some increase in their looting speed, but I wonder if dropping "just" 100$ would worth it.
rm-266	Does it worth to drop 100$ on pets?
rm-267	towards the end of senior year and tht summer idk what happened but i got a hot bod n my face was all "girl u been through some shit have a gift" so now im pretty?
rm-267	I jus made a post on a diff sub about having a nice date today, which is nice, but i am vv hesitant on making frens n stuff cuz of the last two years.
rm-267	so like, after my glow up or whatever more ppl started talkin to me ya?
rm-267	n a lot of boys did too!
rm-267	i never rlly had v many frens so this was a huge yay!
rm-267	the first boy i hung out with was rlly nice but then we got high and i did vv regrettable things i do not like.
rm-267	Well tht boy was super haps n told lots of boys.
rm-268	I dont want to jinx it and call them out by name but im talking with a company and im hoping it works out!
rm-268	Im excited about all things ill be able to do with these free promo products to help other ppl and possibly get them off some or all of their rx drugs!
rm-268	Im excited for myself because i have a bunch of medical issues that i do not use rx drugs for and the other stuff i buy is expensive.
rm-268	This sponsorship will help me, it will help me help others and it will help this company as well.
rm-268	Im ready, im ready!
rm-269	Im hella excited!
rm-269	Might be picking up a new sponsor!
rm-270	Will be posting more here once I get...comfortable again.

rm-270	I’m on and off though, and have quite a bit of messages to go through ~ will get to them when I can :3
rm-270	In the meantime, happy new year!!
rm-270	ps: I don’t have a SC & don’t take any $$$, I just like to.. show off, y’know closet slut things :) lol
rm-270	Ttyl y’all
rm-271	He said "shhh just kis me you fool".
rm-271	I still love him and I cried so much on valentine's weekend (dont judge lmao) , but I said "No. You're f***ed up now.
rm-271	Whats going on?"
rm-271	He never replied to me afterwards, and this interaction took about 10 minutes through text.
rm-271	Today he says "good lord wtf happened.
rm-271	I gotta garden
rm-271	ttyl".
rm-271	He read my reply which said "I'm so worried about you!
rm-271	Why would you take that?
rm-271	Where did you find it and why would you take it?
rm-271	Eat and stay hydrated".
rm-271	I just don't know anymore.
rm-271	I suspected it, but I want him to be upfront about it with me.
rm-271	I love him and he will always be my first and I'll always talk to him and care for him, but I don't want to be held in limbo.
rm-271	I'm trying to move on and this is now in my head.
rm-272	I know when ever I say ttyl or gn or whatever I wanna add an ily. Just casually. To see what happens.
rm-272	I know that every time I get a text from them I get super excited.
rm-272	I know when I am having a bad day just thinking of them makes me feel so much better.
rm-272	Just knowing I can go home and text them brightens my mood ten fold.
rm-272	I know sometimes I day dream about just holding them and being near them.
rm-272	But what I don’t know is what this means.
rm-272	I’ve known them nearly four months now.
rm-272	That’s not long.
rm-272	Makes me feel like this is an infatuation that will pass.
rm-272	Tbh I kinda hope it is bc I don’t think it’s mutual.
rm-272	But oof is it hitting me hard.
rm-272	Is it merely infatuation?
rm-273	Their explanation is that they’re a bad texter, or busy, but honestly so am I(will takes days or a week to respond) but I don’t leave people on read or open messages I know I can’t respond to atm.
rm-273	It really isn’t that hard to send a quick ttyl either tbh.
rm-273	Finally they seem to want to engage w/ me and basically tell me they’re going to an event and they’d hope to see me there, which they reaffirm the next day and then day of.
rm-273	I go to event, they never show.
rm-273	At this point I’m too stressed from a lot of other shit I got going on and it’s not like we’re really talking so I just block them.
rm-274	Idk, I need to change my mindset or this and that for my benefit and survival,
rm-274	I'm still "Ocean Serene" but maybe I'm .. idk that's a tough thing to say, I never thought that my gf was just a random,
rm-274	I love her to death, she is my boo and will always be it.
rm-274	Just like I said allot of things, I'm gonna agree that if I change the world changes,
rm-274	the advice you get, it's allways iffy,
rm-274	I want to speak for everyone but at the same time I can only speak for myself,
rm-274	also I went to get some rum and coke,
rm-274	I got coke and a few other people seen it so they bought some coke.. erm, I hope my friends are ok (that's all you weirdos I'm talking about)
rm-274	random story I know,
rm-274	tbh I'm not ok, but I'm surviving like usual,
rm-274	actually I'm all just a bit Right and fine.
rm-274	Ttyl
rm-275	[bro] Across the country?
rm-275	She acts like 500 miles is a long way.
rm-275	[me] lol, its 8 hrs to [redacted]. 7 to [redacted].
rm-275	not a big deal
rm-275	[bro] I suppose when you don’t maintain your vehicles an hour drive could be detrimental.
rm-275	[me] lol
rm-275	[me] i spose [redacted] or [redacted]'s wife ratted me out.
rm-275	maybe i should block them too
rm-275	[bro] Sorry for her awkward messages.
rm-275	I was in the middle of a drunk nap when she pulled up to my house and I told her you jumped ship.
rm-275	Told her not to try to contact you and we can see how well that went.
rm-275	[me] shiiiiiiiiit. betrayal
rm-275	[bro] I’m sure she’s contacting you for her own self gratification.
rm-276	I was in a toxic rs for 4 months.
rm-276	During our dating period and a month or so into our rs we were great.
rm-276	One day both of us were jealous of each other for no reason.
rm-276	Im going to admit that sometimes when i feel jealous i just want her to reassure me like how i reassure her that its all good but she will only reassure me once and then said bye or ttyl.
rm-276	Most of the time in an argument its always my fault,
rm-276	she wont admit to anything or say sorry.
rm-276	I will always be the one to give in so that the fight wont continue anymore
rm-277	And I said "But yeah yeah you right."
rm-277	And he said "Ye well I gtg. Im doing something" and I was gonna type aight ttyl but I realized we ain’t at that level anymore.
rm-277	I didn’t like that.
rm-277	The vibe was going good.
rm-277	I didn’t have a bad vibe. When the convo started.
rm-277	But once he said he’s doing something my heart dropped.
rm-277	Like what was he doing?
rm-277	He’s never done this before.
rm-277	This was such a different person.
rm-277	I hate it.
rm-277	What can I do?
rm-277	All these attempts I made were basically shut down.
rm-277	I like him but I’m not trying to flirt or do anything!
rm-277	I know he doenst like me like that.
rm-277	We talked about it.
rm-277	Right now I’m just chatting with him.
rm-277	But he doesn’t seem like he...wants to do that.
rm-277	If he doenst want to talk to me he can just fucking tell me.
rm-278	Idk what else to put Besides that i hate the current circumstance of life i live in
rm-278	im gonna give a little insight tomorrow
rm-278	Ok i lied
rm-278	i have to reveal my age tomorrow because if i dont Itll mess up the story
rm-278	Um Idk what to type so ill type a worry i have

rm-278	Ok bye ttyl everyone
rm-279	she said something like "but i want to make sure that we go as a friend?" thing and i was like "okay, i know" and sometimes she talks about her relationship and she said "ofc i like my long time bf"
rm-279	yea, whatever right haha
rm-279	and here's my question...
rm-279	yesterday when i was at work, she msg me saying something like "how's your work doing" and i kinda reply her with cold tone saying "i'm at work ttyl" and then she kinda upset :" Okay, i mean i understand you are at work so busy but u didn’t cut me off like this before so i kinda get it that you dont want to talk anymore like before.
rm-279	got it!

rm-280	and my machine f!@#ing freezes up
rm-280	it's been happening for like 2 days now...
rm-280	this machine can run a goddamn $26,000 3d scanner but 4 browser tabs on reddit and new a chat session uses up 87% OF MY DAMN MEMORY AND 60% of my cpu power and freezes the wholedamn thing up.
rm-281	HEY! WAIT!
rm-281	i've got a new complaint! ..... Seriously WTF are you devs doing???
rm-281	stahp plz
rm-282	If you think it's rude to just walk away in the middle of a conversation without excusing yourself, or at least saying "gotta go I'll talk to you later" then it's also rude when texting.
rm-282	I could let it go if it was a one off,
rm-282	things happen,
rm-282	maybe something came up and you got distracted etc.
rm-282	But EVERY SINGLE PERSON ghosts in the middle of a conversation.
rm-282	It's really not that hard to just say "gotta go, i'll text you later" or "so and so just got home, TTYL"
rm-282	Even just "bye" or "BRB" or something!
rm-283	Today i got mad and just flat out asked him to tell me where the problem was and if i did something wrong.
rm-283	He said he was with his friends and he didn't wanna ignore them just to talk to me,
rm-283	i said it wouldn't be a problem if he had just said something like "i can't talk rn" or "im with my friends ttyl" or just literally anything.
rm-283	He then said i was overthink stuf and i should " chill out" so i left it at that.
rm-283	So AITA and over thinking things?
rm-284	AITA for gerring mad at my bf after he ignored me for a few days
rm-285	So I would usually post this on r/keto but that sub is soooooo intense about their keto.
rm-285	And I respect it.
rm-285	But like, a girl’s gotta rant.
rm-285	I started keto a few weeks ago.
rm-285	Have been doing well, and I feel like I’ve lost weight.
rm-285	Out of nowhere I get slammed with cravings.
rm-285	My body is like "bitch, CALORIES PUHLEAZE"
rm-285	I oh so badly want to make it to my goal weight and flock around on a beach in a bathing suit, and I also want to honor the tenacity that r/keto so proudly espouses in their no cheat days mantra.
rm-285	But, alas, another side of me wants to curl up in my bed with my favorite gluten free dairy free carb dense carrot cake and go to satiety land.
rm-286	Afaik, the concept of mini album is only around in kpop (maybe jpop?)
rm-286	Im always dissapointed when a long awaited comeback or something is only some 4 or 5 songs album.
rm-286	I can tolerate debut album since you really dont have a lot of material, but if youre snsd or something and you come out with mini after years long hiatus like mr mr, its kinda insulting.
rm-287	idk what to say lol
rm-287	i'm pretty funny not only bc i manage to trip over air and choke on my own saliva far too often but also because i'm just fuckin hilarious tbh
rm-287	i'm from yorkshire and that probably makes me cooler than you bc the north is just superior and i'm ready to die on this hill but ig we can be mates
rm-287	i would really like some of those
rm-287	ok i'm running out of people to laugh at my jokes
rm-288	17m from the uk,
rm-288	pls be able to hold a conversation lol
rm-289	Idek what kind of dog this was but it was so ugly
rm-289	my god who would own such a thing.
rm-289	Dogs with wrinkles like pugs, char pays(idk how to spell it), bulldogs, boxers, any dog with those ugly ass wrinkles are so dumb.
rm-289	I’m not a dog hater at all, I love dogs.
rm-289	But the breeds that I mentioned are so fucking ugly and gross they shouldn’t be owned, and I’ve literally be told these kinds of dogs need surgery just to live a proper life.
rm-289	(Wrinkles over eyes cause blindness/ over nose-can’t breathe)
rm-289	and yes I know I’m gonna get shit on my all the fuckin neck beards on reddit that just ADORE their snot nose little pug,
rm-289	idec
rm-289	I’m so tired of people and they’re dogs.
rm-290	Do boobs=nice, coz idk never seen em before
rm-291	then he check the oil level saying that the oil also smell like gasoline that gasoline and oil is mixing up together
rm-291	open one spark plug see the massive leak in there literally full up
rm-291	"let me say oil" smell like gasoline
rm-291	I didn’t smell that one
rm-291	that’s what the worker told me
rm-291	then he call his boss and the boss say is not gasoline is just oil "that shit smell like gasoline 🤦🏾‍♂️
rm-291	even the worker confirm that I ain’t crazy but ayyy maybe I am
rm-291	and his worker" Told me he going to sealed the black thing that goes in top of the spark plug that covers it
rm-291	"sorry my English not that amazing"
rm-291	he said he was putting a sealed after draining the oil as he mentioned
rm-291	is oil drained the oil sealed the thing so oil don’t drip out of it and don’t drip to the floor
rm-291	but didn’t help me find the cause of why is oil getting into the spark plug because a sealed on the coil plug ignition 🤦🏾‍♂️
rm-291	telling me if the problem keeps on is maybe my oil catch can that is sending way to much oil and is causing the oil leak that if the problems persist I will have to remove it
rm-291	Sorry for the long paragraph but need advices,
rm-291	need help tbh
rm-292	My rabbit didn't eat or drink so I went to check him,
rm-292	its been now 4 or 5 hours and I saw him now drink and eat a little bit.
rm-292	I have to give him medicines and the thing which is like food idk.
rm-292	(He has constipation so Imma check does he poop.)
rm-292	How do I sleep if i have to check out my rabbit?
rm-292	My sleep schedule is gonna become chaotic lol.
rm-293	i assume the time has already passed for this but idk i figured i may as well ask,
rm-293	i kinda forgot i even had those tix until they announced they'd be touring again today
rm-294	Now, my aunts (gma’s sisters) are telling me I should not give her half of the money due to the way she treated gma both before and after she passed.
rm-294	When my gma first started getting sick, sis wasn’t the best bc she had just got a new boyfriend.
rm-294	She didn’t reach out a lot to my grandma, and didn’t go to see her.
rm-294	I would go out as much as possible, but gma was also scared of covid.
rm-294	The month before she passed, I told my job i couldn’t come in and would drive the hour to her house and stay with her (back & forth sometimes).
rm-294	I had finals going on at the same time, and had to figure out a place to live.
rm-295	WIBTA if i didn’t give my sister half of our inheritance?
rm-296	So i mett this girl like 2 weeks ago and we are dateing.
rm-296	Last night everything was all right she was happy said good night anda ily like every night.
rm-296	And the next morning when i texted her good morning she left me on seen and blocked me.
rm-296	One of her friend said that she was sad af all day because of me and but diden't want to say why.
rm-296	Idk what i did.
rm-296	I did nothing.
rm-296	What should i do.
rm-296	How can i contact her.
rm-296	Should i give her space?
rm-297	My gf blocked me and idk why
rm-298	Mines ending and all my grades are passable except for biology in witch I have a F,
rm-298	this is because I made the mistake of turning things into her desk and not the bin, meaning I have like 4 or 5 assignments that I've done but are nowhere in the books,
rm-298	this kinda snuck up on me cause I thought they were done and filed only to check my grades and find out they weren't.
rm-298	Anybody else have this problem?
rm-298	(if you at going say "ikr I only have a 89, why couldn't she round up, fml)
rm-298	Imma be honest that's not very helpful rn
rm-299	so first off bard top
rm-299	what a pick ikr.
rm-299	lets drop down my main build cause its the best assasin play style i like.
rm-299	* my core is static/ie/RFC.
rm-299	now i tried many ways and this is the best way
rm-299	i like to safely clear and lay out poke.
rm-299	now under certain occasions like vs a garen id go what many would call shot gun bard swaping out static for runnans and if needed Rfc for pd.
rm-299	giving some more tank..
rm-299	now as for the other two i actually leave them more optional picks in the ap department or in which case magic pen.
rm-299	In this section is a few situations for more sustain
rm-299	id pick up hextech gunblade
rm-299	this item is phenomenal on bard on hits are great.
rm-299	if your already carrying hard id go something like lyiandries cause with the lead no one will catch you with this and the chunk is just bardo crazzzzyyyy.
rm-299	yet two try gunblade and lyandries together but someday.
rm-300	Hey guys bard main,
rm-300	just join reddit after finding out there are other off metta bards!
rm-300	So i main him top,
rm-300	yes its scary but i do.
rm-300	So i been getting alot questions about my builds from friends and happy on lookers lately!
rm-300	thought i share my builds!
rm-301	Im 16 years old 5'9.
rm-301	Im new to basketball and id like to ask for drills i can do by myself so i can be good or even great at it.
rm-301	I only have one basketball and half a court.
rm-301	I dont have a decent shot nor a decent handle,
rm-301	i could barely reach the backboard plus i have no friends so dont even ask how good my defense is.
rm-301	The reason why i wanted to be good at it so bad is because i just want people to know me as somebody cuz right now im a nobody,
rm-301	i want to be SOMEBODY.
rm-301	PS. Ive never played an actual basketball ever in my life.. ikr?
rm-302	Hi guys, I’ve always had a lot of trouble making friends and consider myself kind of standoffish and awkward at times (that cancer rising ykno) but p chill once you get past that.
rm-302	Super loyal and empathetic, pretty smart (when i want to be), goofy, a lil chaotic, big overthinker kinda deal.
rm-302	Enneagram type 4 bc apparently that matters (jk !!!)
rm-302	Honestly really looking for some truly kind, genuine people that might share some of my goals of breaking patterns and cycles, trying to be better, treating others with respect, dignity, and love ... you get the gist :)
rm-303	I dream of becoming a psychiatrist so a program with med school prerequisites would be preferable,
rm-303	plus, I plan to take my med school abroad (wow big dreams much?
rm-303	I doubt I'd get in but it wouldn't hurt to try tho).
rm-303	Academics aside, the community is also important to me,
rm-303	I'd be even more motivated to study if my teachers are kind and if my classmates are easy to get along with.
rm-303	Oh and location too.
rm-303	I'm short so if my classes are ~far~ I might as well roller skate my way through campus jk jk.
rm-304	You set up a dramatic encounter, a dramatic fight, and then Ellie gets the upper hand.
rm-304	Then, you give the player an option.
rm-304	Do you kill Abby, or spare her?
rm-304	That way, players can decide if they want to kill someone who now seems human, and someone they feel bad for, or shoot her ass and laugh as she dies, glad you avenged your former character.
rm-304	Or, ya know... Have Ellie kill Abby.
rm-304	Seriously, doing this would've prevented so much backlash.
rm-304	Easy, simple, you do the thing that the player was expected to do
rm-304	the player goes home somewhat fulfilled.
rm-305	An opinion from someone who hasn't played TLOU1 or 2.
rm-306	So basically, I kind of have a crush right now but I dont know if I want to pursue her
rm-306	its complicated.
rm-306	Right now its summer break so imma wait til school starts again to try for real again.
rm-306	I can actually talk to girls in person cuz they dont talk to me online lol.
rm-306	I dont know how long this series will go but I will try to post every day until it happens.
rm-306	As of right now my confidence in finding a girlfriend is very low.
rm-306	I dont know how long this is gonna take but probably quite awhile.
rm-306	All I want is for someone to love me for me and a girl that I can share my feelings with, since right now I dont have a person to do that with.
rm-307	I would like to take this moment to say, that if youre a kid, like an elementary school kid and youre here, where the fuck are your parents???
rm-307	Lol nvm fuck them.
rm-307	You are so much better than them.
rm-308	Cause I got them and no one to give them too lmao jk unless..........
rm-309	Anyone order 3 large fries, 1 medium sprite and a mcdouble?
rm-310	Hey, hi!!
rm-310	Haha... Im new here, didnt know this existed until now.
rm-310	Iam exteremly shy and dont know what Im doing here typing this hahaha.
rm-310	But hey, first time for everything right??

rm-310	I will cry lmao.
rm-310	I dont expect to get any messages but hey its worth a try.
rm-310	Ps. I dont know how to write these properly so I tried to copy this one post I saw that was in a bullet format omo
rm-310	Oh and if I dont reply soon it might mean Im asleep or playing DnD hehe.
rm-311	Nvm
rm-311	my internet is down rn
rm-311	fuck
rm-312	Well I'm going to see if I can buy some stuff off steam now...
rm-312	let's hope there's still some good sales
rm-313	Okay so I was a totl noob and earesed my seeds since I made a new wallet that I was gonna use but I sent monero to that wallet instead of my new one.
rm-313	I know the password but not the seeds.
rm-313	Is it possible to retrieve your wallet?
rm-313	or how do you open the .key file
rm-313	edit: nvm I'm a complete noob
rm-313	I figured it out.
rm-314	Possible to retrive monero wallet seeds with .keyfile?
rm-315	user765123: no i just had the "is now playing" thing show up
rm-315	A: ik

rm-315	user765123: (not that it rly matters. i just used my irl name)
rm-316	Comment
rm-316	So i can guess ur gender based on ur post history
rm-317	Nvm..lemmee guess ur gender instead
rm-318	So the deadline to drop a full year course with permission from the prof is Oct.18.
rm-318	*(edit. nvm, this part isn't true pls disregard).*
rm-318	The deadline to drop without receiving a grade is Feb.9.
rm-318	Does this mean I still have to inform the prof that I'm dropping the course,
rm-318	do I also have to get permission?
rm-318	I'm planning to take 2 other courses so I still take the same amount of credits btw.
rm-319	I just didn’t have the confidence to speak and tell jokes and stuff.
rm-319	I was actually sweating at the presence of these other people.
rm-319	I was avoiding eye contact and trying to face as far away from them as possible.
rm-319	When I rlly wanted to speak to my friends, I’d quietly mumble a joke to them.
rm-319	But one time, he didn’t hear it and so he was like "what!?" reallyyy loudddly.
rm-319	I felt my heart rate increase and started sweating more.
rm-319	I would just say "nvm" cuz I felt like I was in the mf spotlight.
rm-320	Tbh, have anyone ever experience fighting a 2v1 or maybe a 3v1 against a tank that doesn't die and manage to kill aleast one of you?
rm-320	Talking to that rampage and crunch BUT rampage didn't pop his ult yet.
rm-320	😲Wtf?!
rm-320	Now, again, what would paragon be without the current pressure hunter right now?
rm-320	My guess is a team with growth totem with 2 tanks, a stun-or-not caster, a tanky af fighter, and a carry that solo everything if he wants to.
rm-321	When I turn off those 2 switches it drops down to between. .28- 2.1
rm-321	When they are gone for 2or 3 days at a time and we leave switches on it stays down also.
rm-321	I’m not positive but I think the owners are aware and did it to cut corners.
rm-321	However, always. Possibility that the man behind us did it.
rm-321	So I’ve had enough.
rm-321	I finally decided I’m done paying $300 electric bills so it can be 48 degrees in my house with no hot water.
rm-321	So I know I’m really opening up a can of worms with my landlord but it’s not legal and I shouldn’t have to pay someone else’s expenses nvm the $6000+ that was destroyed simply by being plugged in....
rm-321	oh and the part where I barely sleep at night at fear of burning down and I won’t leave my doggy home alone either in fear a fire will catch while I’m not home.
rm-322	like now I feel guilty for smiling.
rm-322	nvm the fake ones ish, but fuck.
rm-322	haha. ugh.
rm-322	why am I still alive.
rm-323	lol why tf does smiling hurt
rm-324	Then I see a figure slowly walkign towards my general direction, and I finally look up.
rm-324	THE MOMENT I LOOK UP, PAUL IS LOOKING STRAIGHT AT ME, STILL WALKING TOWARDS ME.
rm-324	i DONT SAY ANYTHING OR LOOK BACK DOWN BECAUSE GET THIS: HE SAYS THE FIRST THING HES EVER SAID TO ME IN THE SMEXIEST MOST HOTTEST ATTRACTIVE WAY POSSIBLE.
rm-324	HE SAYS "WHATS UP" IN THIS LOW QUIETER VOICE BUT HAS THE CUTEST BUT AT THE SAME TIME HOTTEST SMILE EVER.
rm-324	I BLOW UP INSIDE AND I SMILE BACK NOT HOLDING BACK MY OVERJOYED EMOTIONS.
rm-324	AND I SAY HI WITH THE BIGGEST SMILE I PROBABLY HAD.
rm-324	IM JSUT PRAYING TO GOD NOW THAT I DIDNT HAVE NASTY STUFF STUCK IN MY TEETH OR THAT MY FACE DIDNT LOOK DISGUSTING.
rm-324	BUT I LOOK STRAIGHT BACK DOWN AT MY FOOD AND POKERFACEDLY KEEP EATING MY FOOD.
rm-324	I DO THAT FOR MAYBE 3 SECONDS,
rm-324	THEN I LOOK BACK UP.
rm-324	PAUL HAS JUST STARTED WALKING AWAY, WHICH MEANS HE WAS STANDING THERE LOOKING AT ME OR DOING GODKNWOS WHAT FOR 3 SECONDS.
rm-325	Edit: yes I know.
rm-325	Plants are important.
rm-325	Oxygen. Useful, I know.
rm-325	But URGHHHH. They really could focus on something more entertaining like how poisons and toxins affect our body.
rm-325	Btw there some great documentaries about it T_T
rm-325	Edit 2: nvm. I’ll just print the thing
rm-326	I was playing normal, just got into an alliance, oops now I'm not getting any mp!
rm-326	Try to type in chat, "I will not cheat on this game!"
rm-326	message repeats every time I hit enter.
rm-326	WTF
rm-326	im not cheating.
rm-326	anyways I type those words into the chat ( "I will not cheat on this game!") and it tells me to pay the server and turn off Adblock.
rm-326	Wort way to tell a player to turn off Adblock but whatever.
rm-326	It tells me to turn off then refresh.
rm-326	I do and lost my best game and restart as a new player
rm-326	10/10 never play again
rm-326	EDIT: nvm, anytime I type in the chat the same shit happens
rm-327	I'm gonna skip the oscar-bait shit like The Post because there's only some much concentrated rage at milquetoast Dems making movies about how (Extremely wonky nasal nerd voice) "politics used to be moooorrreeee poollliitte we neeeeed a return to The Discouuurrrse."
rm-327	I'm sure I forgot a couple.
rm-328	Will he be so much beter that hes worth more than Kinlaw and the player(s) that we pick from the extra picks we get?
rm-328	OT could be there like Thomas but Im just not convinced any guy we take will be better than Little entering his 2nd year.
rm-328	He has health concerns atm but we also have Daley entering his 2nd year and is a decent safety net.
rm-328	Interior oline I think is a major problem but there is no Nelson like prospects that are going in the top 10.
rm-328	Edge might be a need depending on FA and the Iowa guy (can not spell his name) is good but that's still a bit of a reach.
rm-328	If we do not resign Bradberry and Okudah is there that really the only situation I absolutely stay put.
rm-329	2mo ago I bought a cheap '95 nissan truck,
rm-329	I was only locally driving so it took the better part of a week to realize I couldn't put it to 60mph, or that I had to floor it to hit 3500 rpm
rm-329	(although it has a little transmission-slippage from 1st to 2nd **only** when dead-cold, this problem is the engine for sure as I can't rev it past 3k in my driveway w/o feeling like I'm going to break something,
rm-329	I can only get the 3500 rpm when driving and flooring it,
rm-329	it'll hit close-to 3500 right before gear-shifts)
rm-329	I was trying to methodically rule-out what could be causing this power-sap, IE is it the air/fuel or a clogged cat/exhaust/etc or something entirely different?
rm-329	I ruled-out 'different', I think, by seeing that it will roll down-hill just fine in Neutral, so no mechanical interferences.
rm-330	Hey! Read somewhere that it can ruin his puppy teeth and small parts can be dangeroes,
rm-330	is it safe to give him a bone?
rm-330	They are pretty big, almost his size.
rm-331	Can I give my 2mo boston terrier puppy raw beef bones?
rm-332	[HELP] My puppy has suddenly refuaed to poop anywhere except inside
rm-333	friends think she said that cuz she was w her new man and she needed me to not blow her phone up etc.
rm-333	others think its a way for her to be evil, like think of me cuz im never coming to get that charm.
rm-333	i think its some type of hoover, good or bad.
rm-333	any insight is appreciated.
rm-333	if your a woman please tell me your perspective.
rm-333	so confused, bt she is clearly w someone else and why she couldnt call me back and why she didnt respond to my txt msgs.
rm-333	she couldve said im w my bf please dont call me bt she didnt.
rm-334	Just a side note: my bf and i are buying a house.
rm-334	we will be moving out in 2mo.
rm-334	Once the papers are all finalzed.
rm-334	I have an Australian shepherd 9mo.
rm-334	My bf (24m) and i (25f) got her at 3 mo.
rm-334	We take her on play dates every other week.
rm-334	She has a pair of dogs she likes to play tag with a black lab and a dog small dog that is a mix of something.
rm-334	We take her to see a rat terrier.
rm-334	Thier play style is boxing.
rm-334	And one of my roomates (25m) has a beagle.
rm-334	He doesnt like to play much
rm-334	infact he seems kinda scared too.
rm-335	i know all of these things about my dog.
rm-335	i know that it doesn't matter if your dog is friendly, aggressive, or otherwise; doesn't matter if your dog is already barking and growling, or just minding its own business;
rm-335	what matters is that my dog is nervous
rm-335	-- so when i hold my hand out and tell you, no, he's not sitting or lying down because he's calmly waiting for you to say hi, it's because he's nervous and insecure, i DON'T mean it as a joke, and it's NOT an invitation for you to say, "AW WELL MY DOG/CHILD IS VERY FRIENDLY SO LET ME APPROACH!"
rm-335	i don't care if your dog/child is friendly or "dog savvy".
rm-335	i don't care if your dog "is just a puppy"
rm-335	(why the hell is that even relevant?
rm-335	is my dog not allowed to be nervous around other puppies? ??????).
rm-335	i don't care if your child is capable of not screeching "OMG A PUPPYYYYYYY".
rm-336	can you, y'know, DO something about your child? and also your dog?
rm-337	But with less than 3mo to go for that i feel I'm not ready yet but having never taken it I have nothing to compare it to besides collegues advice.
rm-337	Without knowing what I know they can't know if I'm actually ready yet but many of them are pushing me to sign up for it.
rm-337	I want this...bad...amd it would be awesome to be done 6 mo from my intro exam.
rm-337	I'm close... I just don't know if I'm 2mo study close.
rm-338	Somm certified advice
rm-339	(M/5'10"/26/165-195lbs) 2mo progress, gaining too much weight?
rm-340	I know this sounds weird but heres my issue,
rm-340	about 4 months ago i had an 3700X which died after start crashing when i tried to play games and a day later not booting,
rm-340	send to rma, they confirmed the cpu was dead and gave my money back after 2mo,
rm-340	after that i got an 3800X,
rm-340	as soon as i tried got the boot code 7b everything power up but no reboots or video signal,
rm-340	send to rma this time with the store
rm-340	after 1mo they confirmed the cpu was falty send me a new one,
rm-340	i got the new one yesterday, same issue.
rm-341	My mom(T) has always been the type where her feelings matter 1st + only.
rm-341	If something she does is wrong, she manipulates it into being someone elses fault entirely.
rm-341	Ex: I needed some1 to babysit our then 2mo for 3-4 hrs.
rm-341	Dads work had som1 who had COVID,
rm-341	we opted out of them watching our son + askd my sister.
rm-341	I approached this topic as usual with T by trying to talk to her *before* I set it all up b/c I knew it would upset her.
rm-341	T got her hopes up, then its *my fault* \+ she tried getting me to apologize for getting her hopes up.
rm-341	I talked to her *days* after the incident b/c she didnt call me after hanging up on me, told her how I felt about the whole thing,
rm-341	T promptly got off the phone,
rm-341	I nvr got an apology.
rm-341	B still thinks I am owed an apology, other things have happened since then due to Ts narcissism.
rm-341	I dont expect an apology from T b/c she **nvr** has once ever apologized for anything she’s ever done wrong.

rm-380	I have a 4/40 dr oct and i see some pretty good numbers on critical hits and sps so not bad in damage either (like vision).
rm-380	A very viable option for AW attack. and also arenas as u dont have to bait out in those small fights coz u never let them reach sp3 b4 u finish it.

rm-382	anyway to fix this I am on android 6.0 b4 security update and in have root with magisk 16.0
rm-383	Personally, I think VII was (alongside RB1) the best Neps games in the entire franchise,what with having an storyline that doesn come off as too edgy nor melodramatic like Mk2/RB2, but neither as Over-the-top like V/RB3, having the exact and neccesary amount of seriousness and comedy,
rm-383	the characters got much better developed, and everyone (specially Vert,Nepgear and the Twins) got their own time to shine and of course, it proves that the events dont always have to rely on Neptune presence.
rm-384	Gr8 b8, m8. I rel8, str8 appreci8, and congratul8.
rm-384	I r8 this b8 an 8/8.

rm-385	They go up to the board and just starting writing math: meh, ok, thats fine.
rm-385	They then use shit like A sub 1 through A sub 20 for variables.
rm-385	infact, i have a linear algebra book that did this... A's FOR EVERYTHING.
rm-385	the pages were just matrices filled with A's.
rm-385	JUST DRAW A WEIRD SHAPE OR SOMETHING- ANYTHING BUT THAT ISH!
rm-386	Scariest thing 3ver m8
rm-387	Well,well here we are again frustrated, angry in front of my phone
rm-387	what a neat way to start isnt it?
rm-387	All of ya readers are my theraphie and i dont ow you a cent
rm-387	perfect right?
rm-387	If you are like me you are probably not going to read it all cause of your short attention span so lets keep it short(what a genius way to write after a long introduction saying "keep it short im a genius ain't i?")
rm-387	Well a tryed explaining to my budds that porn is kinda shaby and yeah just bad and u know who listened.......
rm-388	Hey,I just want to know what games can I run on this PC and witch nota.
rm-389	I was a spy and on the first night I was jailed and I proudly told jailor my role.
rm-389	I also got attacked whilst in jail.
rm-389	When day 2 had begun, mafia and sk had made their kills.
rm-389	I proudly said: "I was attacked while in jail!",
rm-389	wrong move.
rm-389	Jailor decides to jail me again and ask me "You were attacked while you were in jail?" and I answer "yes m8".
rm-389	He then tells me that what I am saying is bs because sk and maf have already made their kills.
rm-389	Then he executes me.
rm-389	Seriously!?
rm-390	Oh boi u 2 dum for da movie boi,
rm-390	da director wuz like shieeet itz bout da hiden meaningz u have 2 find boi, lyke u kno it duznt spoonfeed ya da film ya kno?
rm-390	Like shieet y it gotta explain m8,
rm-390	just imagine what happened ya know?
rm-390	It's no like I pretend it has a deeper meaning than what it has ya kno?
rm-391	yet when fully charged for the 1st 30-60 minutes, it's always on!
rm-391	which is beaaaautiful!
rm-391	Lastly, if i do not use the Smok Alien for an extended amount of time (say at night when sleeping) the battery reduces when left in the mod and the mod is turned off?
rm-391	wtf m8?
rm-391	I just want to understand if all of this is the same for everyone? or is it just me?
rm-391	in searching google i cannot find an answer to any of these questions.
rm-391	Other than these issues i am really enjoying the mod.
rm-391	its just a fuckin' ball ache every single time i want to vape to have to wait for the fucking thing to go through its motions before i can puff...
rm-392	Everytime i log on i want to chill afk nmz and play xbox and be fat right but, lately i log on play rs afk for like 20secs and i get logged out and its fucking annoying
rm-392	is it my Internet connection or is it the servers or what
rm-392	its pissin me off m8
rm-393	Next we have my Stats class and I didn't realize that we had additional homework to do online as well as the written homework and so my grade was a 70 something and then I bombed my final for it because of some family emergency that popped up involving my uncle and a car in a hit and run.
rm-393	So then my Band class is basically easy A as it's show up to a weekly practice and go to the one concert and so I passed that gg ez m8.
rm-394	Dramatic death scenes and bringing the characters back with a gag do NOT go hand in hand.
rm-395	So I finally got to Blighttown, and was strolling about, minding my business, and a sniper started throwing darts at me.
rm-395	So I was like "wtf m8?" and hid behind some destructible wood.
rm-395	After a certain time, he stopped attacking, so I showed myself and he reappeared, and started with the darts again.
rm-395	So a couple dozen darts after I simply get +500 souls, and that purple moss stuff.
rm-395	So what the hell happened there,
rm-395	did the motherfucker just kill himself in shame or what, he simply died all of the sudden?
rm-396	This years rookie game is actually going to be real exciting,
rm-396	wt line ups u wanna see
rm-397	I love this Show but sadly I’m near to finish it already,
rm-397	how is this called and are there other movies or shows based on this really special kind of story ?
rm-397	I NEVER wt ch movies or so sorry about my mack of vocabulary on this tho, is this called distopian ?
rm-397	Well I’m really lost but I just want some other stuff like this to watch, it’s crazy !
rm-398	Has it happened to anyone else?
rm-398	happened to me number of times
rm-399	So if you're on leg 2 , you have to win 10 consecutive games for the xp and coins , 10 stamina for 40 tickets ,
rm-399	get the fuck outta here EA!!!
rm-400	But now it just doesnt make sence, you only get 1 ticket per match and if you are lucky you will get 10 extra in every 20 matches.
rm-400	Only in leg or WC 1.
rm-400	This tournament was the 1 thing F2p was always abble to do because of the low cost of entrence and the rewards where good enough compared to how many matches you need to play.
rm-400	You got a player extra and if you didnt like him. Use it as XP.
rm-401	[Suggestion] if you dont like the new WT than dont play it.
rm-402	Closed tech support?
rm-402	It's 1:30am and you're a billion-dollar, global enterprise.
rm-402	WT-literal-F?
rm-402	Was your heating bill too much this month so you can't make your rent?
rm-402	You mismanaged bunch of fools.
rm-403	So long story short, I forgot to fill out the housing application for the fall 22 semester and i’m on the waitlist since April.
rm-403	Housing isn’t guaranteed when ur not a freshman and my income isn’t enough for rent sooo
rm-403	there’s a possibility i might be homeless
rm-404	My answer is simple: Have you seen the men nowadays?
rm-404	No. Fking. Competition.
rm-404	Most men this day are thirsty af.
rm-404	The era of gentlemen is over.
rm-404	They are either idiots, look like a half assed rapper or are complete assholes.
rm-404	Often times all of that.
rm-404	In their primitive brains they grab and grunt at everything with 2 legs.
rm-404	And i mean that literally.
rm-404	BUT – thats good for you.
rm-404	If you just behave like a decent human being, then you are already better than 80% of the other dudes.
rm-405	I (24) M an accountant at a traveling company

rs-0	My favorite Obama quote: "Michael and I also wanna uh, acknowledge, uh.....yy...y.yy..uuuhhh..yyy....your son Jack, who deployed today."
rs-1	New-ish player, couple of questions about parrying, etc
rs-2	Basically the title.
rs-2	We're both xxx majors (I'm a dual xxx and yyy major while she's a xxx major and yyy minor, so we are taking 2-3 classes together every semester until graduation in May 2018).
rs-2	While I wouldn't say I'm smarter than her, things tend to come more naturally to me, and I'm a good test-taker, while she has a lot of test anxiety (will often get questions wrong that me and her practice right before the exam, will freak out about not having a formula that was on the formula sheet, etc.), but she easily studies more than I do.
rs-3	Me [20F] with my friend [23F] of 2-3 years; we're both in college together, and she gets massively down on herself every time she takes an exam.
rs-3	It's driving me crazy, how to deal?
rs-4	Her: oh where's this ice luge at haha
rs-4	Me: probs my friend's hotel room/wherever he can find a place for it
rs-4	Me: came to <insert city> w my frat and a sorority – that's why he's getting it
rs-4	Her: gotchaaa
rs-4	Her: what frat and sorority I'm in xxxx
rs-4	Me: yyy.
rs-4	sorority is zzz
rs-4	Me: you're interesting tho.
rs-4	I want to hang out w you.
rs-4	When this week ?
rs-4	Her: uh maybe Friday?
rs-4	Me: ayy yes
rs-4	Me: Friday *one day later*
rs-4	Me: <girl's name> we're hanging out tmro, right?
rs-5	How to go from # to date?
rs-6	i just pretty much dismissed what she said by saying a vibe is not captured by pre googling and confirmed the time that ill be there at.
rs-6	If she gives any further resistance I think ill just next her/ ignore/not respond / agree with her that she can't handle the place , or tease her about the crazy high standards she has for a first frikken date
rs-7	This is a nagging annoyance I have with the word text object.
rs-7	Suppose the cursor is located in the "aaa" word, and I want to yank four words, *without* selecting the spaces after "ddd": > xxx **aaa bbb ccc ddd** yyy
rs-8	It is the bar with the team comp and the status of each characters that is use to follow report team ( like in the actual world cup) .
rs-8	It can be tweak down to not reveal to much info about the red team, but it will make following the killfeed easier and you won't have to use tab
rs-9	The part I'm humming is like "word word word wo-o-o-ord" x2.
rs-9	So he draws out the 4th (?) word.
rs-9	I think it was something like "fly-y-y-yyy."
rs-9	I'm pretty sure it's a popular song, I've heard it many times.
rs-9	Thanks!
rs-10	Having trouble with if / then / else / end in a repeat loop.
rs-11	Hahaha.
rs-11	OMG it's terribl-....yyy funny!
rs-12	I went grocery shopping I'm down to my last dollars soon and I can't just eat beer and cigarettes
rs-12	then I set them down so I didn't have to carry them across the street to get beer (it's cheaper at Adventures First Stop)
rs-12	then I walked back and forgot my groceries walked all the way home and ah shit, I'm getting shin splints from all this walking up and down the hill
rs-12	I live on a hill.
rs-12	down.
rs-12	the middle, really.
rs-12	i imagine it's like an amateur San Fran so I walked back and got them.
rs-12	no crime round these parts.
rs-12	not much, anyway.
rs-13	Hope the title makes sense - Have a list of names "john.baker" (no spacing between names other than the period) and need it broken into 2 colums "john" and "baker" Thanks!!
rs-14	Have To Break Up Format "xxx.yyy" Into two seperate colums "xxx" and "yyy"
rs-15	I am confusion??? whats going on lol.
rs-15	This is my first time with sfu mail, after the sem I haven't touched anything school related until today heh, so idk how to fix this
rs-16	Even better for me it would be: It would be an unbeleafable loss to let a broken an thus spilt bottle be wasted with no return.
rs-16	So to show my sincerest appologies for bumping staight into a nobel that half marched in his drunken stupor, down the sidewalk, straight out of a likor store and making him drop his bottle worth more than what I suppose one of the merchants off the mainsteet makes in a month, I was offerd to finish the wasted goods, less they spoil any further.###-!-###”Y-y-yyy-yes sire!
rs-16	May the heavens cry before your mercyfull heart!"
rs-16	"Now get lost!
rs-16	This is no place for desease ridden vermin like you." "O-off course my lord!" I ran.
rs-16	Back down the alley I squirmed my way out of.
rs-16	Filled to the brim with anger and shame.
rs-16	Sidestreets and alleyways, down I went.
rs-16	Further and furhter out of sight.
rs-17	He, soon as he saw That I was weeping, answer'd, "Come with me."
rs-17	Onward he mov'd, I close his steps pursu'd.
rs-17	Ent'ring he led me with him on the bounds Of a great circle itself encirclign a great abyss.
rs-17	Ere, I beheld an uneven land with lava pyramids cover'd, With sickly farms of melons and carrots, near barren of life Save for those imprison'd in it, who, though they surrounded Us, dar'd not approach for fear of master.
rs-17	As mine ear could note, the sound was heard of screams, Cries, and explosions that made th' eternal air Tremble, caus'd by slaughter, starvation, withering, and Grief felt by those multitudes, many and vast, Of men, women, and children.
rs-18	I recently returned to d2 after several year, now I’m windering: Where do you guys sell/buy your stuff?
rs-18	Do you just make a game “O xxx N yyy” and hope for the best?
rs-18	Or are there a website that’s more efficient?
rs-19	Who is a former (or still) important person in your country, that constantly compromitise himself/herself on social media?
rs-20	Its not until my next billing cycle i notice somtjing was off.
rs-20	I was a bit lower then normal and i keep a vary close eye on my expences.
rs-20	I looked over my bank stanments and there is was.
rs-20	My NEW prim bill.
rs-20	I was super confued and got ahold of amazons custmer suport.
rs-20	They helped me as much as they could, but becuase i was receiving my servese through the phone company i would have to go though them and fiugher out the problem.
rs-20	The next day i had off i walked in and talked to a vary sweet girl who tried to understand what my problem was.
rs-20	We kinda talked in a circle for a bit as i tried to explain what the amazon costmer service told me.
rs-20	We looked me up in there system and there i was 2 lines but no prime membership for either one of us.
rs-20	She could see the date i opened my first line and then the 2ed.
rs-20	Both dated added up to what i had told her before.
rs-20	She stared at the compurter screan for awhile with a confused look on her face.
rs-21	anyways, these terrible memories kept haunting me, so yesterday i finally mustered up the courage to message him.
rs-21	me: hey how's everything
rs-21	him: it's been time
rs-21	me: sorry abt last year, i was super awkward around you lol
rs-21	him: lol nah dwai
rs-21	*
rs-21	DRUM
rs-21	ROLL
rs-21	PLEAAE
rs-21	*
rs-21	me: tbh i liked you blah blah blah
rs-21	him: haha you could've just told me!
rs-21	next time you see me just say hi.
rs-21	do you still go to (school)?
rs-21	I'm not like r/Nicegirls but that reply didn't sit well with me.
rs-22	I'm OUT BOIS :)
rs-23	Now I obviously can't get out and shut it on the main road so I pull down a few side streets and ensure that no one fucking knows I've quickly jumped out and shut it.
rs-23	I jump back in and drive home like nothings happened.
rs-24	I don't remember specifically which, I think both bugs do it, but here in Florida there's a particular bug that makes a loud sound 100× longer than when it's not making a sound.
rs-24	I'd describe it as that trademark dessert ambiance sound.
rs-25	Locusts/Grasshoppers/etc can shut the hell up
rs-26	ive searched far and wide across the internet with nothing to show for it.
rs-26	could even go woah eee ahh ahh/ oh eee ahh/ possiblities are endless and i know its hard just wondering if anyone knows it thanks
rs-27	What to do - plants now waaay small for its age imo and started to grow pistils- should I chop n restart or ???
rs-28	How do you get destiny delicacies I've seen a few ppl have them but I've never got one idek where you get them if anyone knows it would be alot of help☺
rs-29	Everytime i listen to him sht makes so much sense, even tho i dont know what he is talking about, that leads me to belive that either that guy is a genius who can articulate whats going on in the economy right now in a brilliant way, or he may be missing something?
rs-29	I mean what should i listen to if i rly wanna find out the truth if schiff is just "bias to Gold" and thats the reason why he is so hard on the current economy etc.
rs-30	This wouldn’t be an issue if y’all servers ask in the beginning do u guys want a separate check so it won’t be awkward.
rs-30	Also why restaurants have to be set up like that why u can’t just get up to the cashier and pay ur fucking share or food.
rs-31	So idk why o got on everyone nerves about the separate checks....
rs-32	But every time, my nmom says that can't be true because when she was my age, her periods were 3 days long and super light.
rs-32	"It barely ever affected me, so how can it be affecting you so much?"
rs-32	Umm idk, maybe its bc we're DIFFERENT PEOPLE with DIFFERENT BODIES???
rs-33	Does anyone elses nmom treat you like you're overreacting about your period pains?
rs-34	Passed my faa ppl written!!!
rs-35	Alright y’all.
rs-35	I think I mis-tagged this earlier so I’m trying again.
rs-35	I got some not fun fungal acne from running daily w a face mask on my chin/jawline, forehead, & lower cheeks.
rs-35	Once I identified it, **I switched from a face mask to a face shield while running** (I have no issue w being over 12+ ft from other ppl / usually don’t pass anyone on my runs anyways), and then have used the following routine to nuke it over the course of 3 weeks.
rs-36	Had never heard of this "influencer" before and consider myself pretty internet saavy.
rs-36	I then lost interest in her bc her IG wasn't that interesting.
rs-36	She popped back on my radar with the Nancy thread and then she disappeared from my mind again until the Anna article came out and then I took a great interest in checking in on her bc I just found her funny and her antics amusing (in a sad way).
rs-36	So this has been on my mind for a while: How does she continue to have such loyal fans who will send her $$ bc she claims to not being able to afford food or rent or whatever when there is photographic evidence all over her apartment of her bougie taste in decor, perfumes (Byredo perfume costs anywhere from $200-300 a pop), shit tons of plants and flowers which aren't cheap.
rs-37	basically I just found out that this 1 girl is only snapping me again cuz my friend basically told her to (told a friend to tell her) and now I’m 99% sure she’s just snapping me to be nice (plus the delivery times and opened times shit are mad long).
rs-38	what should I do from here someone pls lmk
rs-39	Like I don't rly care what mean shit ppl on the internet say.
rs-39	But when i got nobody IRL all I have is the internet and it do kinda hurt a bit when i just want to vent my problems.
rs-39	And I'd be fine if it got maybe a single upv*te and no comments and I'd be fine.
rs-39	But instead, it's full of people saying
rs-40	I don't like when ppl type huge ass paragraphs or dump a lot of stress on me bout their problems I don't like when ppl mumble on the phone or if they ramble on and it's all about then.
rs-41	I’m talking about “ppl” instead of people “u” or “ur” instead of you or your, “tho” instead of “though” and so on.
rs-41	It’s getting old, and you look like an idiot when you spell like this.
rs-41	just type out the word, it isn’t hard.
rs-42	Maybe a lil earlier idk cause I'm usually at work but my download speed is now stuck at the 64mbs range.
rs-42	Now I understand at peak times it should drop, I even understand that since more ppl are at home I'm gonna see lower numbers, but to go from 500 to 60.
rs-43	I`m courios how likely post on my personal space will be shown to ppl.
rs-43	Pls write "+" in the comment if you see this.
rs-44	hm, mandatory title
rs-45	If anyone says anything remotely offensive on the internet everyone just has to say you can die or something.
rs-45	Do we really care that much?
rs-45	Not really tbh
rs-46	Damn some ppl need to stop overreacting to stuff on the internet geez
rs-47	I’ve come up with a list of all the questions I could think about (there’s kinda a lot lol), so I would reaaaaally appreciate it if someone would take the time to answer them.
rs-47	If anyone is willing to PM me and chat about their test day experience and answer all my questions, that would be great too!
rs-48	I’m gross and only brush in the morning.
rs-48	I guess I see the need bc who the fuck cares.
rs-49	But now it seems that y'all done made grits without the butter and made us madder than a wet hen, I must say!
rs-49	We were fixin to tour more plantations than Carter's got little pills but you done gone and brought up them "slave owners" now.
rs-49	Ain't amountin to nothin more than a hill of beans!
rs-49	If I had my druthers, I'd da just taken my business over yonder to the white-friendly plantation and learnt me somethin decent about history.
rs-49	All this chicanery has got me worn slap out!
rs-49	Y'all get along now, ya hear?
rs-50	How do I break of a relationship with my 'friend'?
rs-51	basically I put my skate account in my Instagram bio cuz I have no posts on my main and I’m kinda insecure abt my body (in some of my clips I’m shirtless and ppl won’t expect me to be like shredded or sum shit if they add me) and today I got like 3 followers (girls from dif towns who don’t know me).
rs-51	i
rs-51	m really picky tho bc I don’t wanna have a relationship unless I actually feel like I’d really fuck w the person and be into them a lot so I didn’t follow any of them back.
rs-52	bro ive gotten added and unadded on ig so many times today that it’s kinda a confidence boost lmao
rs-53	Honestly, most of the posts or memes here are either from ppl who read the novels or the manga.
rs-53	I have to dodge so many spoilers smh.. Nothing else to say, come at me salty ppl lmao

rs-56	Other vegans that youre friends w tell you that they dont tell other ppl theyre vegan?
rs-56	Like the purposefully avoid it.
rs-56	I feel like it fucks over the vegan community cause those are probably the ppl that would be more gentle w their words, which is what some ppl need in order to listen.
rs-56	I
rs-56	m a very straightforward, no sugar coating typa person, and although some ppl appreciate it, a lot more get upset & start trying to put words in my mouth &twisting things.
rs-57	Fellow vegans, does it annoy you when...
rs-58	You honestly deserve to get scammed if you give a random guy on the internet like 300€ worth of fake internet points, like wtf are you doing honestly LOL
rs-59	Why would you give awards to ppl lol
rs-60	Yes i agree things like tumblr made up identities are weird and some people do get offended easily, but if what you said is ignorant/bigoted calling ppl snowflakes is just weak
rs-61	Give your self a pat on your back if you believed and trusted Tom from the start to the end without ANY unsureness and trusted him and never lost hope in the series!

rs-63	Even beter if u outfarm ur oponent.
rs-63	Just dont die.
rs-63	And trades in lane...if u see enemy using his escape ability or even damage ability.
rs-64	And I offered to go out to look at Christmas lights but he was out of town so we couldn’t do that- and now he’s back in town and I asked him what he’s doing on New Years and he said he was going to hang out with two of the managers form our work and likeeeee he didn’t offer an invite and then he said if he cancels with them would I like to come over and I just said idk what I’m doing yet so I don’t know Am I overthinking this?
rs-64	Does he not care?
rs-65	There’s gonna be ppl on the internet saying “stat padder” but other than his weird hesitancy to drive, he played pretty solid

rs-68	Idk why I didn’t clue into This tho.
rs-68	Like I never thought about how ppl have traditions for this night, besides my sister who goes out to her friends every year.
rs-68	It’s funny that covid isn’t affecting my Ny at all..
rs-68	Anyone else in the same boat?
rs-68	Anyway I guess I’ll just watch a movie tonight lol.
rs-69	helo, im looking for ppl to talk to, maybe play some games or watch anime together.
rs-69	just please be aware that im not very good at upholding conversations uwu f/20
rs-70	Like i see vids on yt on it.
rs-70	But like, i cant see any mention on the design notes etc.
rs-70	Where do ppl get the info from?
rs-71	Dm me to debate pls be well learned in your belief.
rs-71	I want dms bc Itll get deep and I cant reply to 300 ppl like that.
rs-71	Also I need 500 characters so here come the blah blah
rs-72	I m not saying that they should be ashamed to be turned into girls or that I m being stereotypical towards a person being a girl but I am saying that they wont like to do it bcoz they r humans with their own choices and not agreeing to be a girl isnt making them a women anti.
rs-72	Like how many guys around you would be willing to turned into disney princesses or to play that butt game?
rs-72	Maybe they get used to this with time [but how much time?] and maybe they know that they have to do all this for the entertainment of fans.
rs-72	but knowing this isn't making anything better for them until they happily and genuinely agree to it.
rs-72	I sometimes feel sad for them when they r asked to do all this.
rs-72	I wont like it if you will try to make me a man and want me to dance in front of so many ppl eventhough I am a tomboy.
rs-73	Anyone missing me?
rs-73	If you miss a reddit friend, read this.
rs-73	IT COULD BE pME!!
rs-74	So I just hopped on PC from Ps4, not even 2.5k games played there, played a few decent games since I frankly suck with a KB&M, and yet for the past week or so I am matching with ppl 2k kills and preds even, yet I haven't even a hundred games played and about 80kills with all characters.
rs-74	Not really having fun anymore, can't improve if I get shit on every game
rs-75	I see a lot of ppl on here who seem hella said, so if u hella sad I’m down to chat.
rs-75	They call me nice cream guy in school bc I’m nice, and I like ice cream lol.
rs-75	So yeah if u down for a chat, or long term friendship, I’ll be more than happy to do so
rs-76	so i always see ppl talk about sending designs and edits to affinity but how do i do that??
rs-76	ive worked at od for almost a year and none of management has mentioned it??
rs-76	like not even the print sup.
rs-76	we do every type of editing in store and i hate it.
rs-76	like we’re out here doing stuff that im pretty sure is supposed to get sent out to affinity based on what i see on here.
rs-76	but yeah is more of this info on the store portal or where can i learn more?
rs-76	i
rs-76	m extremely tired of creating/editing shit for last minute rude customers (:
rs-77	One person in the server was selling the set for 100k and i was like- Hell Nawh That Not Worth 100k- like bruh-

rs-79	Ik the girl I posted abt is a troll ppl- but oh well she got her 6 minutes of fame time to take the posts down
rs-80	HMU with a chat message, tell me about yourself and we can go from there
rs-81	I dont understand how ppl can build what they do...
rs-81	i love building but i guess my creativity isnt well tuned as alotta ppls an it bothers me i cant build amazing stuff i no i could if inhave the creative side uggh i just tend to give up after awhile
rs-81	n settle for simple crap to pass for ok
rs-82	I care abt how I effect ppl a lot but try not to show it.
rs-82	It’s hard for me to join in convos w big groups of ppl which is related to adhd.
rs-82	Sometimes my sensitivity can make me kinda stand offish to ppl idk.
rs-82	I’ll try to act like idc if someone doesn’t like me but drunk ppl will fall to the floor begging them to.
rs-82	These all r adhd things tho bc rsd I’m a good listener.
rs-82	A lot of people view me as really cute or innocent I can have a really really really flirty personality at times.
rs-82	I remember in hs my friends mom said I had the “personality ” so I’d probably be the r first to have a boyfriend
rs-83	but when she’s in the wrong or when someone holds HER accountable she just throws the biggest temper tantrum ever and just disrespects any / everyone who doesn’t agree w her and screams about how she doesn’t care or more specifically in her words “I don’t give a fuck” she’ll NEVER take accountability or apologize and becomes the biggest hypocrite all the things she screams @ ppl to NOT do to her she turns around and does the exact same rude petty shit to any/everyone else that doesn’t agree with her I think the main reason she does this is because my sister acts JUST like my mom and my mom can’t stand it / accept that so she becomes down right nasty.
rs-84	In class I’ve usually been really quiet but sometimes I’ll meet someone I click w in class and be reallyyyy really chatty.
rs-84	I think I get along best with girly fun girls, overly confident queen b feisty type people, and just gossipy people.
rs-84	My friends and their families see me as really bubbly and excitable.
rs-84	Although most people see me as sweet, soft spoken, and quiet.
rs-84	Some people think I never talk thought.
rs-84	I’ve always been a smiley happy person though.
rs-84	I do really like making others happy or seeing people I know and having a friendly conversation.
rs-84	I have adhd.
rs-84	Sometimes I’m at a loss for words or boring.
rs-84	I’m really really chatty when drunk.
rs-84	Although sometimes I’m not when drunk which I heard ppl w adhd are both.
rs-85	Could I be istp ? Help type me pls
rs-86	Idk if ppl would even want to just wanna know if thats allowed, and if not where would be a good place to post that(ive watched dragonmar and other ppls videos but that would be hard to be a me specific video on there)
rs-87	like in a good way tho
rs-88	Some ppl are just indescribable
rs-89	I ain’t done this before but i’ve seen enough to get a gist of it so like interests :)
rs-89	we can definitely talk abt anime (especially romance imma sucker for it), we can talk abt games and go into detail abt lore and shtuff, creepy stories go hard, and really i’m just down for anything :)
rs-89	i’m not gonna be weird so as long as you’re not weird any age or anything is fine with me and uh yeah if i didn’t do this right lmk :)
rs-89	oh and i’ll absolutely talk more on snap
rs-90	I mean yeah tbh it is i care abt a lot of ppl and i cant just... make people be happy.
rs-90	But like.... i wanna :(
rs-91	Just wanna make everybody i care about happy, like is that too much to ask
rs-92	I think that some ppl here are ai or something
rs-93	smh don't even try i can do that by myself🤠
rs-94	Hey, F/19 , bored af , I enjoy talking to new ppl,hmu?!
rs-95	i started chatting with her and a co-worker of hers who was in high school in the late 90s.
rs-95	she said everyone was watching wrestling back then and it was a cool thing.
rs-95	now no one gives a shit😭 (i don’t rlly blame them sometimes).
rs-95	i asked her “why do u think ppl stopped liking it” and she said “cause it’s garbage.
rs-95	it’s come on fox on fridays and as soon as 7 o’clock hit i change the channel” i had to include that in there bc she’s so funny😂😂😂anyways.
rs-96	Hey, Cant fall asleep and this platform seems pretty interesting, hmu if u think we could hit off well, hope we have a great time ,future chat buddy ;)😁
rs-97	kinda weird ngl
rs-98	These mfs can outrun, out swim or out stam (through venom) anything that tries to get it.
rs-98	Mine is literally covered in scars head to toe from escaped or successful fights.
rs-99	just finished the show so i’m a lil behind everyone but equally obsessed and want to talk about it so much lol.
rs-99	also by sidestory i mean something that’s not part of the main plot!
rs-100	One of the best game ever that I play!
rs-100	But have some probs..
rs-101	I’d always heard of mac for years but never really checked him out in detail until a couple months ago and now he’s one of my favorite and most often listened to artists rn.
rs-101	Anyways that was just my thoughts, Happy new years everyone hope the new year treats u well.
rs-102	Now for this one it's kinda hard because the enemies are SOOO COOL for this game, but...
rs-102	If I had to choose, I'd say I like the Clown the most.
rs-102	I just think their design and movement is super neat.
rs-102	Plus they are one of the few if not THE only enemie in the game that doesn't have a single other Variation from what I remember.
rs-103	Honestly I wasn't gonna make one but I want to at least give my two cents especially since I dsagree with a lot of others list, not to say my list is right bc this is all subjective anyway which Is why I hate making them.
rs-104	Here we go again, another character fighting tier list!YAYYYY
rs-105	Imo lily for the most part is a rather likeable character (keep in mind ive only played a bit of season 1 up to like part of ep 3)unlike her father lily tries to work with lee and for the most part the group she does what she has to she is a bit of a bitch cause she has to i only have 1 problem with lily she killed carly
rs-105	if you could get ben to confess yes i got spoiled on that and a few other things ben is useless he is what looks like a collage student yet he is useless and needs rescuing 24/7
rs-105	pls dont downvote me into oblivion if i missed something
rs-106	I pretty much just use it for drums and I like making complex beats so 4 isn't really cutting it anymore and piano roll editing drums kinda sucks IMO.
rs-106	Is there a way to make the step sequencer into 8th or 16th notes in FL?
rs-107	I’m not a trans man, but I am interested in knowing someone’s perspectives who lived both as a woman and as a man (not a lot of people get to experience what it is like to be perceived as both genders) so thats kinda neat imo
rs-108	I don't think he did the role justice.
rs-108	I feel before neo figured it out the way he was speaking was ok, but after...IMO he should of went full Hugo weaving speech.
rs-109	Just wanted to share my opinion not being a united fan, on the game against burnley.
rs-109	(not that many of you will care).
rs-109	Mctominay sheeeeesh what a guy.
rs-109	Thought that shaw was solid, now youve got two good left backs in good form.
rs-109	Also wanted to say awb had a muhc better game i thought.
rs-109	AFter the shitty games and dalot playing well I personaly thought awb improved alot.
rs-110	I would be fine if it was changed to tome can ONLY drop at 4-6, yes this also ties into the item drop timing issues but for me I can live with those issues but not this, pls change
rs-111	Kind of an odd question imo, but I have a bp who I just got to eat f/t for the first time (yay!!!), but she seems to prefer medium rats.
rs-111	I've tried f/t large rats with no success.
rs-111	First medium I offer and I got her to eat.
rs-111	Could be a fluke though.
rs-112	Ik it's like a meme or something of "dark souls player complains about the combat" or something similar, but I just don't get the combat.
rs-112	I can do ds3 deathless, I know how to parry at about above average skill, I have played a shit ton of Ghost of Tsushima lately, ik not a difficult game but hear me out rq if you know the game.
rs-113	OMG!
rs-113	WHY do so many morons try to download PC game torrents when firstly they dont have ANY idea of how a torrent even works (its so damn easy though!) comments like "The link doesnt work" Rofl!
rs-113	Yes, it works completely fine!
rs-113	Your just way too dumb to know you need a torrent program.
rs-114	😤Idiot morons 😡😡🤬
rs-115	So i get tipped on the app, gave me cash at the door, then took away the tip on the app after?Wtf is even the point of that?
rs-115	This shit has never happened before but now it’s happened 3 times this week.
rs-115	Once the cash tip was LESS than the app tip...
rs-115	If your are tipping both, TIP BOTH.
rs-116	Ngl tft is a good mode ,but its like hs a good game to play on your phone not something to grind out all day all night like wtf ? Its not even that engaging (ideal game to turn on prep up and alt tab until its next time u can do anyhing)
rs-116	any thoughts?
rs-117	i know its a scientific things and all but some of the post there is just too much.
rs-117	learning dream languages???
rs-117	wtf?
rs-117	and some bloke is saying "i tried the 3 jump and eat banana method but didnt lucid dream?!" every few hours.
rs-117	maybe the post are just giving a litte too imaginative?
rs-118	Like everyone is gathered and shows fake smile, fake dance, fake love and I am like Dear lord wtf is happening ooooh
rs-119	So I am I first time cup user and i got the saalt cup at target.
rs-119	I decided to do a dry run in the shower today and it went in pretty fine after a few different fold methods were attempted (C-fold+17yovirgin=ow) I got in in w/the 7 fold and it may not have been perfect but a great first try.
rs-119	I go to take it out and how tf am i supposed to do this with my long ass acrylic nails.
rs-119	In one way, it kind of helped me ~find~ the cup lowkey grip but god damn was it difficult trying not to stab myself.
rs-120	Didn’t think about nails...
rs-121	Is he gonna tell her?
rs-121	If so how would that convo go down?!!!?
rs-122	Okay wtf Arlo now knows sera ( idk how to spell her full name) is Johns weakness
rs-123	First of all, we've seen they are greedy as f(OK, not as other mobile studios, but stiiiiiill) Second, game needs a lot of work to work well (even if it was designed for high end phones) Even that (oh, Allah may forgive me) damn Fornite mobile is better optimized nowadays.
rs-124	Wtf are you yanks on
rs-125	See also: (on an article about how it's "40 degrees in some parts of Europe") > wtf lol that's not hot at all put on a jakcet dummies ("[city] experiences average annual temperatures of 16C") > zomg thats rly cold im never moving to canada
rs-126	Someines it will cause me to have racing thoughts, others it chills me tf out and gives me nods similar to codiene, why the hell is this?
rs-126	I think it has something to do with wether or not a woman looks at me and thinks Im ugly, if that happens I get anxious From it, but ifva women looks at me and feels indifferent and even thinks im decent looking, I get good effects from the stuff.
rs-126	WTF IS GOING ON
rs-127	If you shoot an enemy then crouch to become invisble, even if they don't detect you they will waltz right over to exactly where you are.
rs-127	Sneak is garbage in this game.
rs-127	I shouldve just grabbed an smg and power armor.
rs-128	I finally beat him after so many trys most of them being on his second phase, his 3rd phase I beat first time.
rs-129	Only me guess its so broken?
rs-129	I got 7 place on last event with Magaki but have 2960 points and get 50 frags instead 80 for 7-10 place.
rs-129	Why?
rs-129	Becuz i have less than 3000 points.
rs-129	(i need 55 magaki frags and i get 50, just feel my suffering)
rs-129	Also in other event with gamer764 i have \~8000 points and got 4 place and got rewards for 4 place, not for 1, whats need 7k points or more.
rs-129	Are the developers too greedy?
rs-130	I made plans to go camping during a day we were goin to see each other and I got a bunch of texts on how she wished I was still free Wednesday and so I canceled it and now she won't stop saying sorry that's not what she meant.
rs-130	Wtf
rs-130	do I do I told her I was going on another one next month(lie) to make her feel better but I didn't.
rs-131	But, I don't neccesarily need top of the line if that also means the light will be heavy and bulky.
rs-131	I prefer high speed, low drag equipment.
rs-131	Would prefer to use AA batteries rather than being tethered to 16850s.
rs-131	Can you recommend something?
rs-131	Thanks
rs-132	Okay so I've got less than a chapter left in GotM and I still can't understand wtf Oponn is trying to achieve through all their/its meddling.
rs-132	Is there something I'm missing, is it continued in another book, or is it just a dead end?
rs-133	It actually got like 7 updoots Yhall are whack
rs-134	Wtf i posted a litteral anime foot and still didn't even make most controversial post of DAY. let alone all time
rs-135	So huh you cant alpha karthus ult wtf is this bs?
rs-136	It would be very helpful all of you OP's out there actually said wtf it was that everyone is talking about before going on a banter about it! Such as "now I understand why this (brand name) thing has everyone going crazy"...
rs-136	To someone that is not constantly in the loop about the different changes, that doesn't mean much to me.
rs-136	If it's too long to type, reference the original post, news article, video, whatever that the beginning of your post.
rs-137	And the scary thing, I am not in the "DFW teams are cursed" camp or a #FireJD type.
rs-137	However, some of this stuff is bugging me to much.
rs-137	When Corey Perry being signed by the Stars is not the biggest potential WTF transaction among DFW teams, that is a bad sign.
rs-138	I’m building a pc but in the mean time I use a crappy 13 year old pc I got money for rust bought it and it took 4 hours to download 1 hour to load and 5 hours to load a server after I hit a tree with my rock my game crashed at this time it was 12:47 am and I just said f**k it and went to bed ready for a hull lot of s**t today
rs-139	EM opens the door:

rs-139	Why did u give your kid permission to enter my houses with out my promises.
rs-139	EM:
rs-139	GT just wanted smores and to find treasure.
rs-139	GK pulls out one of the treasures from his backpack.
rs-139	My GF faces just turned red because the treasure he found was her dildo.
rs-139	GF snatches that out of GT hand.
rs-139	GF:
rs-139	This isn't meant for kids.
rs-139	GT:
rs-139	But its mine I found it and finders keepers.
rs-139	EM: Give him back his treasure.
rs-139	Me: Why the fuck are u not watching your son EM because he has embarrassed my GF and enter my home without permission.

rs-141	She left for another dude (a player), has strung me along this whole time pretty much and been hot n cold.
rs-141	Now shes onto another guy as of the end of March and is currently on vacation with him for 9 days in another state
rs-141	However, she takes the same bike trail as me (the only one) for the past few months and we run into each other every couple weeks and have small talk.
rs-141	About a week and a half ago we talked for well over an hour on the trail.
rs-141	Kind if disrespectful to the new bf huh?
rs-141	We get along and she told me happy birthday on May 3rd, however, i will not be wishing her one today.
rs-141	Birthdays are a big deal to her but i cant think of a reason why i should…
rs-142	After going "uhh no?" She sends me a picture of said candle holder.
rs-142	From her kitchen.
rs-142	I of course go "wtf you're home??" and turns out she left an hour ago from the hospital.
rs-142	No updates.
rs-142	No phonecall.
rs-142	So Im beyond pissed that I was even concerned for three days.
rs-142	Tldr
rs-142	:
rs-142	sickly nmom went into hospital for 3 days, I find out shes home because of a candle holder.
rs-143	ts been a few years and i dont care to look back so long as we can be happy together but
rs-143	its really hard for her.
rs-143	The thing that hurts her the most is i let her go through my phone after finding the nudes and there was a message i sent to someone on Facebook in response to her calling me beautiful bc of a song i made that i was sharing.
rs-143	I was very flirtatious maybe more so than i was with my gf when i was first talking to her and that has been choing in my gfs mind.
rs-143	Its been extremely difficult for her we have two dogs now i was hoping us having two pups to love would help draw her back to being in love with me again bc we have them to bond over but she still cant say “i love you too” she doesnt accept when i try to give her compliments bc ive said rude things in the past when i use to drink (2 years ago).
rs-144	You can try fancy elaborate games but if you stink and dress like shit, best of luck to you but i dont see it happening.
rs-144	Working as a waiter has definitely forced me to up my grooming by trumming my nails, wearing versace crystal noir and ither fragrances etc. Which i believe is the reason why most girls even if theyre taken at least are willing to have a convo with me.
rs-144	Rejection is the ultimate tool for self development and even though ive been shot down by countless numbers of women in my life, i never let it get me down and i
rs-144	m so proud of myself for even having the confidence to speak to these women even though i may not have hollywood good looks or charidma like will smith xD.
rs-144	You guys are all beautiful and i wish you all the best of success with finding your companions :)
rs-145	Shes 18 inches long & weighs 56 grams at 15 months.
rs-145	Just curious if this is a pretty average growth rate for females or is she growing really fast?
rs-145	She eats like an absolute champ every 4-5 days and shes already longer than some males get so I'm curious!
rs-146	the anime is about an mc thats in a game but she doesnt realise it but the system says shes dead and etc i would like to wath the rest of it soo plz help me.
rs-147	Lookking for a anime
rs-148	Idk if to others its strange, but to me it was.
rs-148	I got covid by kissing another guy for the first time, so i had to tell my mum.
rs-148	I couldve just lied and say it was cuz of sharing cups or kissing a girl since in BI, but i knew my parents would be accepting... so i told them as it was.
rs-148	My mum was VERY dissapointed because she thought she new me well, and though i told her everything but now she couldnt trust me anymore cuz bla bla bla... basically he was very dissapointed in me, and actually took time to convince her that i didnt feel like telling her because its private to me... till today she doesnt really trust me like before, but shes ok lol.
rs-149	Today its my birthday so im sharing my ''strange'' comming out story
rs-150	So me and my friend started playing val again and want us to learn comms such as heaven and all of that, now I know what heaven is but I don't know others and if there is a website I would be happy to have to look at it :D
rs-150	(If your still confused ill give a scenario "I hit the jett, shes in heaven" like the location.
rs-151	Shes an awesome cook does all the grocery shopping.
rs-151	My aunt and I will be helping out too, but shes not a good cook either LOL.
rs-151	So I want to make their lives easier by meal prepping, and to make sure my mom is eating wellshe cant be eating junk recovering!
rs-152	(I got this a lot where a girl gets hired and I have to help them, they are always rude to me for no reason, unless the woman is older or its a guy)She
rs-152	's all nice and sweet to everyone else but she's just rude to me.
rs-152	She will take credit from me and blame me when stuff goes wrong(not to my face).
rs-152	The moment she is around guys and other people, she belittles me.
rs-152	She talks good about herself, takes my credit then blames me when something goes wrong and everyone in my department goes along with it.
rs-152	Which is wrong, when she is there she doesn't do any work and clowns around with the guys but only when the managers aren't there.
rs-152	The worst part about it is people really like her and think me and her are close friends.
rs-153	The "false advertising" on thr A4 passive is very easy to understand if you just read the whole skill were it says multiple buffs cant co exist.
rs-153	Maybe im the only one but i think this is all dumb and alsp kills a lot of peoples excitement.
rs-153	I dont like to hear people freaking out for no reason over a five star lol.
rs-153	Its just like zhongli.
rs-153	He was fine but everyone freaked because he wasnt doing enough to dumster content and was balanced.
rs-154	Ive seen lots of ppl in the fandom make rude/racist comments about liberty and its disgusting please leave her alone.
rs-154	And you do realize shes black?
rs-154	stop making fun of the actors ethnic features its honestly rude and not cute.
rs-154	There is nothing wrong with her lips or having big lips in general its not even funny honestly its just sick and not cool to behave like that.
rs-154	And its not even just liberty I've seen people talk about Sav and also Jimmys hair.
rs-154	(also mods please dont take this down I really want people to see it and I have done nothing wrong I've been having some of my post randomly deleted for no reason)
rs-155	( As simple as removing the salad and remaking it without guac.)
rs-155	She then told me we gave her less meat when I brought back THE SAME PLATE sans guac.
rs-156	SHES HOME FOR THE FIRST TIMEE
rs-157	SHESS FINNALLY BACKK
rs-158	I am making this because of one reason only.
rs-158	I have to keep my pup im her crate at night bc if i dont she will poop on the floor.
rs-158	So theres already 6-8 hours of her being inactive.
rs-158	Then i have work - which is again 6-8 hours.
rs-158	I have to keep my corgi in my bathroom at this time because if i dont she will reek havoc unsupervised.
rs-159	AITA for starting a fight with an old friend (Strong Swearing)
rs-160	So me and my crush were on a group chat on snapchat with my friend, me and my friend were arguing as a "joke" and then she said she prefered older guys, and my friend was (M14) and i said im a year older than you, and she says "what i mean by older guys i mean age 17" and it hurt my heart.
rs-160	TLDR; my crush says she prefers dudes who are 17 years old and im 16 and shes 15 and it broke me down.
rs-161	Hello I am new on here but idk if I am the butthole or entitled one this story, this is short but I was expecting to get a tat for my 18 bday like any 18 year old but I wanted to go to this one shop that my brother goes to I dm the artist I wanted but nothing for 2 months like yea I understand they booked for summer tats but at least say "hey I am booked for the rest of ____" but I was like ok will I am gonna look at another artist work from this shop that does small tats same thing happens no answer
rs-161	so
rs-161	me and my brother decides "ok let's go to the shop and ask then we well at least get a answer"
rs-161	we go and this young girl attends us lets call her (brenda) I told her everything, brenda said "well u can do the tat with me"
rs-161	I said "I'll be back i'll think about it"
rs-161	I got back in the car and scroll through her work it was good work so I went back and told her yea let's do this I signed everything she didn't even ask for ID which I found weird bc I gotten my piercings done by the same shop and they needed to have ID on records and so on I brushed it off since shes new and all she worked on me for a hour told me all the necessary tattoo care stuff and said after 3 or 4 weeks to let her know if there need to be fixes and that it was on her I was like ok great thanks, 4 weeks passed and there was alot of mistakes made bc I got a small tat heartbeat with a ";" in the middle but the period on top was a small heart the right side of the heart was smaller then the other side and some of the lines were thick to thin then broke to thick again
rs-162	So I reset it and yeah oops was doing it wrong all this time.
rs-162	Did anyone else kick it away and get mad it wasn't dying?
rs-163	Then afterwards she began to text very dry ? and like through text she kinda sounded mad.
rs-163	I texted her in the night yesterday asking if shes mad and like she said shes only abit let down ?
rs-163	I was really confused afterwards as she began to drag text me and like i apologized to her and she said its alright .
rs-163	Then i just told her im going to sleep and she just left my message on delivered and like she didnt reply to today.
rs-164	How to tell whether she's mad at me or just annoyed cuz rn im really confused
rs-165	WIBTA if I was just be a bigger sarcastic Asshole to another Asshole?
rs-166	Her tumors are behinning to open through her skin, she wont jump, pain killers dont help, she ate a lot yesterday but wont eat or drink today, she hid most the day but..... Its hard because shes alert.
rs-166	It feels wrong because she looks at me like "i love you.
rs-166	Im happy your here with me" but the vet said she wasnt even supposed to live this long and the tumors will only get worse and even if we had done chemo, it would have only prolonged it.
rs-167	friend told my girlfriend something, she then broke up with me, i dont know what to now because she and the ex friend where the only people that i had.
rs-167	what should i do to try and regain my relationship because shes helped me through alot over our 2 years of dating
rs-167	TLDR
rs-167	gf broke up with me bc something someone said and i want to regain relationship with my gf
rs-168	He waited for me to leave to fire someone who has been a dedicated employee bc shes a poc with tattoos and”fits the part” of someone he considered would be on drugs.
rs-168	It makes me sick.
rs-168	I reported all this high up bc I need to protect my staff but I’m worried that this will turn around and bite me.
rs-169	My ex looooves kids.
rs-169	She was playing captain save a hoe, almost caught a domestic case over this woman's situation with this girl's "crazy" baby daddy.
rs-169	They moved fast.
rs-169	They were in eachothers life.
rs-169	it hasn't even been two months!!!
rs-169	IM SO HURT.
rs-169	SHE NEVER WANTED TO BUILD A LIFE WITH ME.
rs-169	I KNEWWWWW she would be all in if I had a kid on me.
rs-170	Theyve grown out to the point they look kinda awkward and shes saying i should get them filled, but would it be weird or bad (like for my nails) or anything to ask about getting them completely redone with something Id like better?
rs-171	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA SHE SAID SHE MIGHT HAVE SOME CLOTHES THAT FIT ME IM DYINGGGG SHES SO SUPPORTIVE AND NICEE OMGGG
rs-172	So its 0:34 the first of January while posting this and my Sister (f14) just Ruined my New Year by Calling my Mum Fat and telling her shes a drinker when she Poured herself a glass of champagne, wich she only does on her Birthday on chrismas eve and on New year.
rs-172	Now my Parents are pissed of, my grandparents are pissed off and my Sister thinks she was Funny.
rs-172	The same thing happend on Chrismas eve and now the whole feeling of new year is gone and i hate my sister.
rs-172	P.S. English is my second language so sry for spelling
rs-173	Screw INTJ’s.
rs-173	Why they gotta be good at EVERYTHING?!
rs-174	It was a MISTAKE getting the booster the day before new years.
rs-174	I feel like absolute dog water.
rs-175	literally most of today we spent cuddling and talking about random shit and i almost cried🙏 im so happy bro.
rs-175	shes so cool.
rs-175	im gonna ask her to be my girlfriend at midnight :)
rs-175	also, happy nye/happy ny everyone!!
rs-176	first of all, the satisfaction i get from saying i am the manager when customers ask for one is amazing.
rs-176	a high i’ll never come off of.
rs-176	second of all, customer comes in for the second time mad because i didnt do copies from a book because of copyright.
rs-176	she goes “well i called customer service and they said you were not supposed to reject me like that”.
rs-176	and im like ?? ma’am its in our policy idc what customer service says.
rs-176	she keeps on being rude and yapping then throws the book on the counter and goes “make my copy” like lol not when you act rude like that.
rs-177	our cat is getting fixed on the 11th, and shes such a cuddly, loving, little girl and i love her cuddles every night and in the morning im just scared that she isnt gonna be like that after she gets fixed?
rs-177	am i over thinking it?
rs-177	do you think since shes in the habit now and loves cuddles and such she'll do it all her life?
rs-178	Me and my partner have this running joke that I domt fart.
rs-178	It started out as a joke after I told her that as an answer to a truth or dare question on our first date.
rs-178	Recently shes been asking me if i'll fart infront of her.
rs-178	She says her friends have all heard their partners fart and its weirf shes never heard me do it.
rs-179	I can't believe she saying im depressed looking while shes so shy girl and weird thinking she's not,so delusional i hate it,but they are mine only friends,she calling me cringe without a reason...
rs-180	Mine friends are mean and delusional,one is immiture and shy and always pulling me down,other is fine just jealous and its getting on my nerves,what to do?
rs-181	This is a set up I can live with.
rs-181	My bf and my's fear however is in a few years when we're ready to settle down, Gina will be wanting to move in and be long term with her own bf.
rs-181	I'm very stuck.
rs-181	I love my boyfriend and desperately want to keep his system happy.
rs-181	But I am not going to allow anymore pushing of the boundries.
rs-181	What do I do here?
rs-182	Boundry Issues w/ my boyfriends alter
rs-183	She was super keen for a second date and we arranged a location but not a date, due to the Christmas holidays.
rs-183	I appreciate it’s a busy period for people, so our responses were like 1 per day.
rs-183	She was upfront when we met and said shes sh** at texting, and has apologies when we were speaking for slow replies, something which I said don’t worry, I know your busy!
rs-183	Convo seems to flow well, lots of questions from her side in the conversation, however I’ve not received a response for 3 days (unread)
rs-183	but
rs-183	she’s viewed my story & posted a story since, it was NYE.
rs-184	So i was all ready for the new year actually thinking positive and the changes im going to make etc then i see hes posted a picture of them both that shes took saying 'love of my life'.
rs-184	It destroyed me.
rs-184	He also put a status about 2022 being a special one.
rs-184	Talk about rubbing it in my face
rs-185	Exes bf posted a pic of them :(
rs-186	Everytime i ask other people for advice on this situation, they all tell me that she’s probably insecure and looks up to me (even tho shes older wtf) and that i shouldn’t blame her for the way she feels.
rs-186	I cannot deal with her, she drains the life out of me, I cannot talk about anything without her either trying to copy me or compete with me.
rs-186	Recently ive been losing weight, and our family members noticed and commented on it.
rs-186	In the corner of my eye, i could see her getting uncomfortable and then obviously she brang herself up and started talking about her accomplishments.
rs-187	We agree to seperate as our marriage was hitting a nose dive in general.
rs-187	2 months later we get back together.
rs-187	We do intensive therapy and things seem to be great im sooooo happy.
rs-187	On our anniversary month wat do i see on his phone snapchat.
rs-187	I look on it again i see jane but this time i can look at there conversation history throughout this whole year and last.
rs-188	So i just got my first beardie.
rs-188	Hes only a moth old and like most new owners im worried about if hes or she is not eating enough.
rs-188	I try to feed him in periods throughout the day but so far ive only been able to feed about 6-7 crickets .
rs-188	Ive tried feeding him some vegies too but the guy doesnt show any interest in them.
rs-188	Is there anything Im doing wrong or is he just fine and im overly worried.
rs-189	Then I foundout about this really cool website called Complex
rs-189	.
rs-189	Theyre sort of like journalism but better since theyre all about hip hop.
rs-189	I found out about Travis Scott through complex.
rs-189	before I listened to trash artists with no aesthetic but travis scott made me realize that aesthetic is really important.
rs-189	now i like tame impala and ive started dressing weirder, i bought my first pair of joggers last week and hopefully ill wear them soon.
rs-190	is it just me cringing at the twitter posts by albatross?
rs-190	everyone who knows who he is knows his stance.
rs-190	hes making it seem like xvg is a sinking ship atm and its doing fine.
rs-191	soo i have this friend IRL.
rs-191	man the dude is known everywhere.
rs-191	hes got a solid rep in the streets, in the jails, everywhere this guy goes everyone knows him.
rs-191	he was trying to explain to me how to get more karma on reddit because i feel like i'm not really known.
rs-192	how do you get hella karma?
rs-193	Im 21 hes about to be 23, my issue is that he seens to have no ambition anymore, he doesnt work and doesnt make an effort to finish school, even small trade schools for a certification as an emt, he failed it the first time by 2 points and I think he fears failure that he doesnt really want to try anything anymore.
rs-193	Hes been unemployed for over a year now and failed that school almost a year ago.
rs-194	Ive gotten super smough about 5 times but i always get stuck in his nuclear butt bomb aura.
rs-194	I swear im far enough away but it still shocks me in 1 hit.
rs-194	Im using 2H battle axe +10 gargoyle helm and naked (even with tattered armor it doesnt seem to make a difference) Chloranthy ring and ring of steel protection.
rs-194	Any tips?
rs-194	I know throwing myself at them enough times ill get them but its slowly wearing at my sanity.
rs-194	I know what to do but i seem to always get caught in a dumb combo or something.
rs-195	I bet you didn’t bother reading the whole number, or noticed the letter I put in there, annnd now you’ll go back to check only to realize there was no letter.
rs-195	What I if also told you, you read this sentence wrong too?
rs-195	*WELL NOW THAT I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION* I hope you’ll carefully read through the rest of this post :^)
rs-196	19/F Aww shit, here we go again for the 7754378435116th time
rs-197	If I just wana make draven my 1 carry how should i do it.
rs-197	I know hes a good unit but what items can turn him into a god.
rs-197	I tried heali g sword n rfc but i get lost after that.
rs-198	Atlus is a great character however his shield is gun is op and his rewind ability is somewhat annoying.
rs-198	However the most annoying thing is his shield.
rs-198	If you place down the shield and just use it to stop bullets thats fine.
rs-198	However
rs-198	I was playing as Skye today and threw my ult at his shield.
rs-198	It did not activate because it got absorbed.
rs-198	Idk about other players oppinions but I believe that Atlus should be nerfed a good bit so hes not op evough to counter everything.
rs-198	Tell me what you ppl think
rs-199	I didn't think anything of it so when I went to give the last cookies on the shelf to him the EK started screaming "MOOOOOMMYYYYYY HE STOOOOLE MY COOOOOOKIES!!!"
rs-199	At first I was startled i started to get nervous and i froze.
rs-199	Then EP walks up and starts yelling "GIVE THOSE COOKIES FROM MY DAUGHTER GIVE THEM BACK!!"
rs-199	And I did not know what to say at first but then something came so mind just say " but I didnt."
rs-199	But the way I said was so cautious.
rs-199	Then my sister takes the cookies from my hands and handed them to my dad.
rs-199	That's when my dad noticed (hes old sad he didn't realise a little bit ealier) he called a manager to the seen and the manager told us to continue and he'll deal with it.
rs-200	We broke up 2 months ago.
rs-200	We had very little contact.
rs-200	But tmrw im no longer putting up with it.
rs-200	He would be the one to reach put all the time.
rs-200	I never reached out first.
rs-200	And if I answered it was only about the class he was paying me to do.
rs-200	He is still on my car insurance and he messaged me on friend asking what was going on with it.
rs-200	I answered the next day and said i didnt change anything.
rs-200	After that part of the convo ended i asked him how he was doing about the death of his dog.
rs-200	(He is deployed and his dog was his world)
rs-200	he said that hes good when he doesnt think about it and how he told his mom to cremate him etc.
rs-201	Day 1 of no contant starts tmrw.
rs-201	Help.
rs-202	So me and a friend ended up making a poster we used my name and ill credit his Instagram below hes a good guy im glad we got both our ideas in the poster for the game and or story would you guys like either home made lore or not?
rs-202	i could=t post this on the fallout Reddit for some reason, wouldn't let me put the photo hope its good guys!
rs-203	is it even possible for itsoktocry to blow up outside of the 3 songs hes had do extremly well? Like get burst into the mainstream rather than just have a few albums do well then fall off?
rs-204	Me and my friend have been playing Minecraft together for awhile and they made their own server so we can play on it together alone, cool.
rs-204	I have always told my friend how much i despises griefers because they dont just destroy something in a game they destroy HOURS of work and it fucking sucks.
rs-204	My friend lately has been really mean to me when we are playing, constantly saying im mean if i dont go half way across the map to give him material that can be easily obtained where he is, literally repeating to me non stop how im 'mean' or a 'bad person' because im busy doing something so i cant go give him his shit.
rs-205	Well I finally get a chance to let loose and have a wine date with a childhood friend of mine that I dont see often at all.
rs-205	We drink (at my house) while the kids are playing and such.
rs-205	Nothing heavy,we do get slightly tipsy ya know.
rs-205	Towards the end, my husband sends me a fb message saying hes ready for her to leave (she'd been there 2 hrs at this point) and then he starts passive aggressive cleaning in front of us.
rs-206	Hes going through a divorce so he keeps telling me thats taking all his money.
rs-206	I didnt give him a title as I didnt even get one when i bought it.
rs-206	It was salvage from some guys as a used car lot.
rs-206	They gave me a bill of sale but I've long since lost it.
rs-206	Should take him to court or do y'all think its not worth it?
rs-206	Also if I did want to how would i?
rs-207	So I just told this guy in my class who was also weird af and gave it to him saying oof I sat on jt it broke do u just want it.
rs-207	Hes like no ew.
rs-207	I have ocd and immediately got ashamed and was like lol whys it gross it's the same as a whole one and along that line like lol why and he was like ok oof it's not and I'm like lol why did you say that.
rs-207	I was saying it jokingly but I'm afraid I looked weird like wtf whys she upset or playfully upset that I dont want it.

rs-210	Hey gyz just wanted to share this helpful app with you all :D .
rs-210	Its not tht i am trying to promote this app or something, it really helped me a lot thts why thought it might evn help u gyz out .
rs-210	I 've seen quite a lot of people struggling to increase their team ovr's and many are thinking to buy players but cant decide which will boost their team ovr's the most .
rs-210	This app helps to calculate the ovr of ur team after filling all the players in their respective positions.
rs-210	It is really tough for most people(f2p players) to keep on buying and selling players to decide our team ovr since it will result in a huge loss of coins(coz of 10% EA tax).
rs-211	Whats the wecommended amount of wedicated wam i shud have to servur?
rs-212	IF u r readin this, u shud b ashamed ov yurself, u shud b sleep,go 2 bed i say

rs-235	Aita , me (31f) asked my kids dad (43m)to help me finish off stripping wallpaper in kids room so I can finish decorating it.
rs-235	I recently had surgery and am not ment to lift too much or stretch but felt OK n thought I could do it alone .
rs-235	I can't, I hurt my incisions so asked him to help do the top of walls were I can't reach .
rs-235	He said yes n today came to do it , after a bit said he was done and leaving, I gave him £20 n said how greatful I am for the help .
rs-235	Checked room once he left ...
rs-235	both kids beds full of torn off we wallpaper , draws cracked where he stood on , iv still 2 walls left unfinished and have spent last 45 min picking up wallpaper from everything.
rs-235	His kids sleep on these beds , aita if I confront him about the mess or shud I let it go n not bother asking in future
rs-236	my boyfriend gets impatient easily and gets annoyed when i ask dumb questions (example, i didnt know how to fill my tire and he got annoyed after he explained it once and then said “why is it hard….. just fill it” so i tried to do it but i failed.
rs-236	later he was like “babe… it took you an hour to fill your tire?” then when i do it myself and dont ask him he goes “why dont you ask me, i can teach you/help you” but i refrain from asking becuz he gets frustrated
rs-237	The last couple calls had arguments as he got mad cuz I beat his ass in video games (even tho gaming is his only hobby) and I’ve left wondering if our relationship is worth the trouble.
rs-237	I’ve talked abt him to lots of my irl friends and they all ask why I continue to be his friend and I can never confidently answer why.
rs-237	But he’s depressed and lonely and wants my attention as I’m one of the only ppl who actively tries to interact w him online.
rs-238	yeah Ik shoes don't match.
rs-238	they match the graffiti tho !
rs-238	I'm trying alot of different styles so lmk what I shud change

rs-240	I want a logical explanation Plz , n if one don’t exist well I mean cuz loooong before … I was “of age” so to speak … for lack of more efficient words that would be appropriate cuz I don’t drink but I’ve … hmm I’m an adult let’s put it like that there’s other stjfff out there but Long before thag me and my Family saw a UFO even mg step dad said he couldn’t think of what else it could’ve been and me and my friends saw this white hooded thing in a park about 10 feet tall n like … it doesn’t really scare me cuz I think it’s the way life is things change they don’t always have to make sense , and others say that

rs-265	Hi, I was wondering wheter or not it worths to drop some money on pets.
rs-265	Like I saw how much some ppl can spend on them to get good results (like t4), and I wouldnt want to spend that much :D.
rs-265	Currently I have 5 t1 pets, and I wouldnt mind to see some increase in their looting speed, but I wonder if dropping "just" 100$ would worth it.
rs-266	Does it worth to drop 100$ on pets?
rs-267	towards the end of senior year and tht summer idk what happened but i got a hot bod n my face was all "girl u been through some shit have a gift" so now im pretty?
rs-267	I jus made a post on a diff sub about having a nice date today, which is nice, but i am vv hesitant on making frens n stuff cuz of the last two years.
rs-267	so like, after my glow up or whatever more ppl started talkin to me ya?
rs-267	n a lot of boys did too!
rs-267	i never rlly had v many frens so this was a huge yay!
rs-267	the first boy i hung out with was rlly nice but then we got high and i did vv regrettable things i do not like.
rs-267	Well tht boy was super haps n told lots of boys.
rs-268	I dont want to jinx it and call them out by name but im talking with a company and im hoping it works out!
rs-268	I
rs-268	m excited about all things ill be able to do with these free promo products to help other ppl and possibly get them off some or all of their rx drugs!
rs-268	I
rs-268	m excited for myself because i have a bunch of medical issues that i do not use rx drugs for and the other stuff i buy is expensive.
rs-268	This sponsorship will help me, it will help me help others and it will help this company as well.
rs-268	Im ready, im ready!
rs-269	Im hella excited!
rs-269	Might be picking up a new sponsor!
rs-270	Will be posting more here once I get...comfortable again.
rs-270	(Self love is impt!)
rs-270	I’m on and off though, and have quite a bit of messages to go through ~ will get to them when I can :3
rs-270	In the meantime, happy new year!!
rs-270	ps:
rs-270	I don’t have a SC & don’t take any $$$, I just like to.. show off, y’know closet slut things :) lol
rs-270	Ttyl y’all
rs-271	He said "shhh just kis me you fool".
rs-271	I still love him and I cried so much on valentine's weekend (dont judge lmao) , but I said "No.
rs-271	You're f***ed up now.
rs-271	Whats going on?"
rs-271	He never replied to me afterwards, and this interaction took about 10 minutes through text.
rs-271	Today he says "good lord wtf happened.
rs-271	I gotta garden ttyl".
rs-271	He read my reply which said "I'm so worried about you!
rs-271	Why would you take that?
rs-271	Where did you find it and why would you take it?
rs-271	Eat and stay hydrated".
rs-271	I just don't know anymore.
rs-271	I suspected it, but I want him to be upfront about it with me.
rs-271	I love him and he will always be my first and I'll always talk to him and care for him, but I don't want to be held in limbo.
rs-271	I'm trying to move on and this is now in my head.
rs-272	I know when ever I say ttyl or gn or whatever I wanna add an ily.
rs-272	Just casually.
rs-272	To see what happens.
rs-272	I know that every time I get a text from them I get super excited.
rs-272	I know when I am having a bad day just thinking of them makes me feel so much better.
rs-272	Just knowing I can go home and text them brightens my mood ten fold.
rs-272	I know sometimes I day dream about just holding them and being near them.
rs-272	But what I don’t know is what this means.
rs-272	I’ve known them nearly four months now.
rs-272	That’s not long.
rs-272	Makes me feel like this is an infatuation that will pass.
rs-272	Tbh I kinda hope it is bc I don’t think it’s mutual.
rs-272	But oof is it hitting me hard.
rs-272	Is it merely infatuation?
rs-273	Their explanation is that they’re a bad texter, or busy, but honestly so am I(will takes days or a week to respond) but I don’t leave people on read or open messages I know I can’t respond to atm.
rs-273	It really isn’t that hard to send a quick ttyl either tbh.
rs-273	Finally they seem to want to engage w/ me and basically tell me they’re going to an event and they’d hope to see me there, which they reaffirm the next day and then day of.
rs-273	I go to event, they never show.
rs-273	At this point I’m too stressed from a lot of other shit I got going on and it’s not like we’re really talking so I just block them.
rs-274	Idk, I need to change my mindset or this and that for my benefit and survival, I'm still "Ocean Serene” but maybe I'm .. idk that's a tough thing to say, I never thought that my gf was just a random, I love her to death, she is my boo and will always be it.
rs-274	Just like I said allot of things, I'm gonna agree that if I change the world changes, the advice you get, it's allways iffy, I want to speak for everyone but at the same time I can only speak for myself, also I went to get some rum and coke, I got coke and a few other people seen it so they bought some coke..
rs-274	erm, I hope my friends are ok (that's all you weirdos I'm talking about) random story I know, tbh I'm not ok, but I'm surviving like usual, actually I'm all just a bit Right and fine.
rs-274	Ttyl
rs-275	[bro] Across the country?
rs-275	She acts like 500 miles is a long way.
rs-275	[me] lol, its 8 hrs to [redacted].
rs-275	7 to [redacted].
rs-275	not a big deal
rs-275	[bro] I suppose when you don’t maintain your vehicles an hour drive could be detrimental.
rs-275	[me] lol
rs-275	[me] i spose [redacted] or [redacted]'s wife ratted me out.
rs-275	maybe i should block them too
rs-275	[bro] Sorry for her awkward messages.
rs-275	I was in the middle of a drunk nap when she pulled up to my house and I told her you jumped ship.
rs-275	Told her not to try to contact you and we can see how well that went.
rs-275	[me] shiiiiiiiiit.
rs-275	betrayal
rs-275	[bro] I’m sure she’s contacting you for her own self gratification.
rs-276	I was in a toxic rs for 4 months.
rs-276	During our dating period and a month or so into our rs we were great.
rs-276	One day both of us were jealous of each other for no reason.
rs-276	Im going to admit that sometimes when i feel jealous i just want her to reassure me like how i reassure her that its all good but she will only reassure me once and then said bye or ttyl.
rs-276	Most of the time in an argument its always my fault, she wont admit to anything or say sorry.
rs-276	I will always be the one to give in so that the fight wont continue anymore
rs-277	And I said “But yeah yeah you right.”
rs-277	And he said “Ye well I gtg.
rs-277	Im doing something” and I was gonna type aight ttyl but I realized we ain’t at that level anymore.
rs-277	I didn’t like that.
rs-277	The vibe was going good.
rs-277	I didn’t have a bad vibe.
rs-277	When the convo started.
rs-277	But once he said he’s doing something my heart dropped.
rs-277	Like what was he doing?
rs-277	He’s never done this before.
rs-277	This was such a different person.
rs-277	I hate it.
rs-277	What can I do?
rs-277	All these attempts I made were basically shut down.
rs-277	I like him but I’m not trying to flirt or do anything!
rs-277	I know he doenst like me like that.
rs-277	We talked about it.
rs-277	Right now I’m just chatting with him.
rs-277	But he doesn’t seem like he...wants to do that.
rs-277	If he doenst want to talk to me he can just fucking tell me.
rs-278	Idk what else to put Besides that i hate the current circumstance of life i live in im gonna give a little insight tomorrow Ok i lied i have to reveal my age tomorrow because if i dont Itll mess up the story Um Idk what to type so ill type a worry i have Umm i dont think ill get the tapegun intime Ok bye ttyl everyone
rs-279	she said something like "but i want to make sure that we go as a friend?" thing and i was like "okay, i know" and sometimes she talks about her relationship and she said "ofc i like my long time bf" yea, whatever right haha and here's my question... yesterday when i was at work, she msg me saying something like "how's your work doing" and i kinda reply her with cold tone saying "i'm at work ttyl" and then she kinda upset : "
rs-279	Okay, i mean i understand you are at work so busy but u didn’t cut me off like this before so i kinda get it that you dont want to talk anymore like before.
rs-279	got it!
rs-279	bye!
rs-280	and my machine f!@#ing freezes up it's been happening for like 2 days now... this machine can run a goddamn $26,000 3d scanner but 4 browser tabs on reddit and new a chat session uses up 87% OF MY DAMN MEMORY AND 60% of my cpu power and freezes the wholedamn thing up.
rs-281	HEY! WAIT!
rs-281	i've got a new complaint! ..... Seriously WTF are you devs doing???
rs-281	stahp plz
rs-282	If you think it's rude to just walk away in the middle of a conversation without excusing yourself, or at least saying "gotta go I'll talk to you later" then it's also rude when texting.
rs-282	I could let it go if it was a one off, things happen, maybe something came up and you got distracted etc.
rs-282	But EVERY SINGLE PERSON ghosts in the middle of a conversation.
rs-282	It's really not that hard to just say "gotta go, i'll text you later" or "so and so just got home, TTYL" Even just "bye" or "BRB" or something!
rs-283	Today i got mad and just flat out asked him to tell me where the problem was and if i did something wrong.
rs-283	He said he was with his friends and he didn't wanna ignore them just to talk to me, i said it wouldn't be a problem if he had just said something like "i can't talk rn" or "im with my friends ttyl" or just literally anything.
rs-283	He then said i was overthink stuf and i should " chill out" so i left it at that.
rs-283	So AITA and over thinking things?
rs-284	AITA for gerring mad at my bf after he ignored me for a few days
rs-285	So I would usually post this on r/keto but that sub is soooooo intense about their keto.
rs-285	And I respect it.
rs-285	But like, a girl’s gotta rant.
rs-285	I started keto a few weeks ago.
rs-285	Have been doing well, and I feel like I’ve lost weight.
rs-285	Out of nowhere I get slammed with cravings.
rs-285	My body is like “bitch, CALORIES PUHLEAZE”
rs-285	I oh so badly want to make it to my goal weight and flock around on a beach in a bathing suit, and I also want to honor the tenacity that r/keto so proudly espouses in their no cheat days mantra.
rs-285	But, alas, another side of me wants to curl up in my bed with my favorite gluten free dairy free carb dense carrot cake and go to satiety land.
rs-286	Afaik, the concept of mini album is only around in kpop (maybe jpop?) I
rs-286	m always dissapointed when a long awaited comeback or something is only some 4 or 5 songs album.
rs-286	I can tolerate debut album since you really dont have a lot of material, but if youre snsd or something and you come out with mini after years long hiatus like mr mr, its kinda insulting.
rs-287	idk what to say lol i'm pretty funny not only bc i manage to trip over air and choke on my own saliva far too often but also because i'm just fuckin hilarious tbh
rs-287	i'm from yorkshire and that probably makes me cooler than you bc the north is just superior and i'm ready to die on this hill but ig we can be mates i would really like some of those ok i'm running out of people to laugh at my jokes
rs-288	17m from the uk, pls be able to hold a conversation lol
rs-289	Idek what kind of dog this was but it was so ugly my god who would own such a thing.
rs-289	Dogs with wrinkles like pugs, char pays(idk how to spell it), bulldogs, boxers, any dog with those ugly ass wrinkles are so dumb.
rs-289	I’m not a dog hater at all, I love dogs.
rs-289	But the breeds that I mentioned are so fucking ugly and gross they shouldn’t be owned, and I’ve literally be told these kinds of dogs need surgery just to live a proper life.
rs-289	(Wrinkles over eyes cause blindness/ over nose-can’t breathe)
rs-289	and yes I know I’m gonna get shit on my all the fuckin neck beards on reddit that just ADORE their snot nose little pug, idec I’m so tired of people and they’re dogs.
rs-290	Do boobs=nice, coz idk never seen em before
rs-291	then he check the oil level saying that the oil also smell like gasoline that gasoline and oil is mixing up together open one spark plug see the massive leak in there literally full up “let me say oil” smell like gasoline I didn’t smell that one that’s what the worker told me then he call his boss and the boss say is not gasoline is just oil “that shit smell like gasoline 🤦🏾‍♂️ even the worker confirm that I ain’t crazy but ayyy maybe I am and his worker” Told me he going to sealed the black thing that goes in top of the spark plug that covers it “sorry my English not that amazing” he said he was putting a sealed after draining the oil as he mentioned is oil drained the oil sealed the thing so oil don’t drip out of it and don’t drip to the floor but didn’t help me find the cause of why is oil getting into the spark plug because a sealed on the coil plug ignition 🤦🏾‍♂️ telling me if the problem keeps on is maybe my oil catch can that is sending way to much oil and is causing the oil leak that if the problems persist I will have to remove it Sorry for the long paragraph but need advices, need help tbh
rs-292	My rabbit didn't eat or drink so I went to check him, its been now 4 or 5 hours and I saw him now drink and eat a little bit.
rs-292	I have to give him medicines and the thing which is like food idk.
rs-292	(He has constipation so Imma check does he poop.)
rs-292	How do I sleep if i have to check out my rabbit?
rs-292	My sleep schedule is gonna become chaotic lol.
rs-293	i assume the time has already passed for this but idk i figured i may as well ask, i kinda forgot i even had those tix until they announced they'd be touring again today
rs-294	Now, my aunts (gma’s sisters) are telling me I should not give her half of the money due to the way she treated gma both before and after she passed.
rs-294	When my gma first started getting sick, sis wasn’t the best bc she had just got a new boyfriend.
rs-294	She didn’t reach out a lot to my grandma, and didn’t go to see her.
rs-294	I would go out as much as possible, but gma was also scared of covid.
rs-294	The month before she passed, I told my job i couldn’t come in and would drive the hour to her house and stay with her (back & forth sometimes).
rs-294	I had finals going on at the same time, and had to figure out a place to live.
rs-295	WIBTA if i didn’t give my sister half of our inheritance?
rs-296	So i mett this girl like 2 weeks ago and we are dateing.
rs-296	Last night everything was all right she was happy said good night anda ily like every night.
rs-296	And the next morning when i texted her good morning she left me on seen and blocked me.
rs-296	One of her friend said that she was sad af all day because of me and but diden't want to say why.
rs-296	Idk what i did.
rs-296	I did nothing.
rs-296	What should i do.
rs-296	How can i contact her.
rs-296	Should i give her space?
rs-297	My gf blocked me and idk why
rs-298	Mines ending and all my grades are passable except for biology in witch I have a F
rs-298	, this is because I made the mistake of turning things into her desk and not the bin, meaning I have like 4 or 5 assignments that I've done but are nowhere in the books, this kinda snuck up on me cause I thought they were done and filed only to check my grades and find out they weren't.
rs-298	Anybody else have this problem?
rs-298	(if you at going say "ikr I only have a 89, why couldn't she round up, fml) Imma be honest that's not very helpful rn
rs-299	so first off bard top what a pick ikr.
rs-299	lets drop down my main build cause its the best assasin play style i like.
rs-299	* my core is static/ie/RFC.
rs-299	now i tried many ways and this is the best way i like to safely clear and lay out poke.
rs-299	now under certain occasions like vs a garen id go what many would call shot gun bard swaping out static for runnans and if needed Rfc for pd. giving some more tank..
rs-299	now as for the other two i actually leave them more optional picks in the ap department or in which case magic pen.
rs-299	In this section is a few situations for more sustain id pick up hextech gunblade this item is phenomenal on bard on hits are great.
rs-299	if your already carrying hard id go something like lyiandries cause with the lead no one will catch you with this and the chunk is just bardo crazzzzyyyy.
rs-299	yet two try gunblade and lyandries together but someday.
rs-300	Hey guys bard main, just join reddit after finding out there are other off metta bards!
rs-300	So i main him top, yes its scary but i do.
rs-300	So i been getting alot questions about my builds from friends and happy on lookers lately!
rs-300	thought i share my builds!
rs-301	Im 16 years old 5'9.
rs-301	I
rs-301	m new to basketball and id like to ask for drills i can do by myself so i can be good or even great at it.
rs-301	I only have one basketball and half a court.
rs-301	I dont have a decent shot nor a decent handle, i could barely reach the backboard plus i have no friends so dont even ask how good my defense is.
rs-301	The reason why i wanted to be good at it so bad is because
rs-301	i just want people to know me as somebody cuz right now im a nobody, i want to be SOMEBODY.
rs-301	PS.
rs-301	Ive never played an actual basketball ever in my life.. ikr?
rs-302	Hi guys, I’ve always had a lot of trouble making friends and consider myself kind of standoffish and awkward at times (that cancer rising ykno) but p chill once you get past that.
rs-302	Super loyal and empathetic, pretty smart (when i want to be), goofy, a lil chaotic, big overthinker kinda deal.
rs-302	Enneagram type 4 bc apparently that matters (jk !!!)
rs-302	Honestly really looking for some truly kind, genuine people that might share some of my goals of breaking patterns and cycles, trying to be better, treating others with respect, dignity, and love ... you get the gist :)
rs-303	I dream of becoming a psychiatrist so a program with med school prerequisites would be preferable, plus, I plan to take my med school abroad (wow big dreams much?
rs-303	I doubt I'd get in but it wouldn't hurt to try tho).
rs-303	Academics aside
rs-303	, the community is also important to me, I'd be even more motivated to study if my teachers are kind and if my classmates are easy to get along with.
rs-303	Oh and location too.
rs-303	I'm short so if my classes are ~far~ I might as well roller skate my way through campus jk jk.
rs-304	You set up a dramatic encounter, a dramatic fight, and then Ellie gets the upper hand.
rs-304	Then, you give the player an option.
rs-304	Do you kill Abby, or spare her?
rs-304	That way, players can decide if they want to kill someone who now seems human, and someone they feel bad for, or shoot her ass and laugh as she dies, glad you avenged your former character. Or, ya know... Have Ellie kill Abby.
rs-304	Seriously, doing this would've prevented so much backlash.
rs-304	Easy, simple, you do the thing that the player was expected to do the player goes home somewhat fulfilled.
rs-305	An opinion from someone who hasn't played TLOU1 or 2.
rs-306	So basically, I kind of have a crush right now but I dont know if I want to pursue her its complicated.
rs-306	Right now its summer break so imma wait til school starts again to try for real again.
rs-306	I can actually talk to girls in person cuz they dont talk to me online lol.
rs-306	I dont know how long this series will go but I will try to post every day until it happens.
rs-306	As of right now my confidence in finding a girlfriend is very low.
rs-306	I dont know how long this is gonna take but probably quite awhile.
rs-306	All I want is for someone to love me for me and a girl that I can share my feelings with, since right now I dont have a person to do that with.
rs-307	I would like to take this moment to say, that if youre a kid, like an elementary school kid and youre here, where the fuck are your parents???
rs-307	Lol nvm fuck them.
rs-307	You are so much better than them.
rs-307	To any kids here, heres my advice: first off, drop out of school ASAP.
rs-307	Its a fucking joke.
rs-307	Also, run away from home asap and do a lot of hard drugs.
rs-307	Meth kicks ass bro!
rs-307	Try that first.
rs-307	Also treat your teachers like shit and throw things at them.
rs-307	Put tacs on their stools and shit.
rs-307	Fuck all authourity.
rs-307	ATAC.
rs-307	Also beat up anybody who is mean to you.
rs-307	Jk ;)
rs-308	Cause I got them and no one to give them too lmao jk unless..........
rs-309	Anyone order 3 large fries, 1 medium sprite and a mcdouble?
rs-310	Hey, hi!!
rs-310	Haha...
rs-310	Im new here, didnt know this existed until now.
rs-310	Iam exteremly shy and dont know what Im doing here typing this hahaha.
rs-310	But hey, first time for everything right??
rs-310	If we dont click and you lose interest then please tell me, no ghosting please.
rs-310	I will cry lmao.
rs-310	I dont expect to get any messages but hey its worth a try.
rs-310	Ps.
rs-310	I dont know how to write these properly so I tried to copy this one post I saw that was in a bullet format omo
rs-310	Oh and if I dont reply soon it might mean Im asleep or playing DnD hehe.
rs-311	Nvm my internet is down rn fuck
rs-312	Well I'm going to see if I can buy some stuff off steam now... let's hope there's still some good sales
rs-313	Okay so I was a totl noob and earesed my seeds since I made a new wallet that I was gonna use but I sent monero to that wallet instead of my new one.
rs-313	I know the password but not the seeds.
rs-313	Is it possible to retrieve your wallet?
rs-313	or how do you open the .key file
rs-313	edit: nvm I'm a complete noob I figured it out.
rs-314	Possible to retrive monero wallet seeds with .keyfile?

rs-315	(not that it rly matters.
rs-315	i just used my irl name)
rs-316	Comment So i can guess ur gender based on ur post history
rs-317	Nvm..lemmee guess ur gender instead
rs-318	So the deadline to drop a full year course with permission from the prof is Oct.18.
rs-318	*(edit. nvm, this part isn't true pls disregard).
rs-318	*
rs-318	The deadline to drop without receiving a grade is Feb.9.
rs-318	Does this mean I still have to inform the prof that I'm dropping the course, do I also have to get permission?
rs-318	I'm planning to take 2 other courses so I still take the same amount of credits btw.
rs-319	I just didn’t have the confidence to speak and tell jokes and stuff.
rs-319	I was actually sweating at the presence of these other people.
rs-319	I was avoiding eye contact and trying to face as far away from them as possible.
rs-319	When I rlly wanted to speak to my friends, I’d quietly mumble a joke to them.
rs-319	But one time, he didn’t hear it and so he was like “what!?” reallyyy loudddly.
rs-319	I felt my heart rate increase and started sweating more.
rs-319	I would just say “nvm” cuz I felt like I was in the mf spotlight.
rs-320	Tbh, have anyone ever experience fighting a 2v1 or maybe a 3v1 against a tank that doesn't die and manage to kill aleast one of you?
rs-320	Talking to that rampage and crunch BUT rampage didn't pop his ult yet.
rs-320	😲Wtf?!
rs-320	Now, again, what would paragon be without the current pressure hunter right now?
rs-320	My guess is a team with growth totem with 2 tanks, a stun-or-not caster, a tanky af fighter, and a carry that solo everything if he wants to.
rs-321	When I turn off those 2 switches it drops down to between. .28- 2.1 When they are gone for 2or 3 days at a time and we leave switches on it stays down also.
rs-321	I’m not positive but I think the owners are aware and did it to cut corners.
rs-321	However, always.
rs-321	Possibility that the man behind us did it.
rs-321	So I’ve had enough.
rs-321	I finally decided I’m done paying $300 electric bills so it can be 48 degrees in my house with no hot water.
rs-321	So I know I’m really opening up a can of worms with my landlord but it’s not legal and I shouldn’t have to pay someone else’s expenses nvm the $6000+ that was destroyed simply by being plugged in.... oh and the part where I barely sleep at night at fear of burning down and I won’t leave my doggy home alone either in fear a fire will catch while I’m not home.
rs-322	like now I feel guilty for smiling.
rs-322	nvm the fake ones ish, but fuck.
rs-322	haha.
rs-322	ugh.
rs-322	why am I still alive.
rs-323	lol why tf does smiling hurt
rs-324	Then I see a figure slowly walkign towards my general direction, and I finally look up.
rs-324	THE MOMENT I LOOK UP, PAUL IS LOOKING STRAIGHT AT ME, STILL WALKING TOWARDS ME.
rs-324	i DONT SAY ANYTHING OR LOOK BACK DOWN BECAUSE GET THIS: HE SAYS THE FIRST THING HES EVER SAID TO ME IN THE SMEXIEST MOST HOTTEST ATTRACTIVE WAY POSSIBLE.
rs-324	HE SAYS "WHATS UP" IN THIS LOW QUIETER VOICE BUT HAS THE CUTEST BUT AT THE SAME TIME HOTTEST SMILE EVER.
rs-324	I BLOW UP INSIDE AND I SMILE BACK NOT HOLDING BACK MY OVERJOYED EMOTIONS.
rs-324	AND I SAY HI WITH THE BIGGEST SMILE I PROBABLY HAD.
rs-324	IM JSUT PRAYING TO GOD NOW THAT I DIDNT HAVE NASTY STUFF STUCK IN MY TEETH OR THAT MY FACE DIDNT LOOK DISGUSTING.
rs-324	BUT I LOOK STRAIGHT BACK DOWN AT MY FOOD AND POKERFACEDLY KEEP EATING MY FOOD.
rs-324	I DO THAT FOR MAYBE 3 SECONDS, THEN I LOOK BACK UP.
rs-324	PAUL HAS JUST STARTED WALKING AWAY, WHICH MEANS HE WAS STANDING THERE LOOKING AT ME OR DOING GODKNWOS WHAT FOR 3 SECONDS.
rs-325	Edit: yes I know.
rs-325	Plants are important.
rs-325	Oxygen.
rs-325	Useful, I know.
rs-325	But URGHHHH.
rs-325	They really could focus on something more entertaining like how poisons and toxins affect our body.
rs-325	Btw there some great documentaries about it T_T
rs-325	Edit 2: nvm.
rs-325	I’ll just print the thing
rs-326	I was playing normal, just got into an alliance, oops now I'm not getting any mp!
rs-326	Try to type in chat, "I will not cheat on this game!"
rs-326	message repeats every time I hit enter.
rs-326	WTF im not cheating.
rs-326	anyways I type those words into the chat ( "I will not cheat on this game!") and it tells me to pay the server and turn off Adblock.
rs-326	Wort way to tell a player to turn off Adblock but whatever.
rs-326	It tells me to turn off then refresh.
rs-326	I do and lost my best game and restart as a new player 10/10 never play again
rs-326	EDIT: nvm, anytime I type in the chat the same shit happens
rs-327	I'm gonna skip the oscar-bait shit like The Post because there's only some much concentrated rage at milquetoast Dems making movies about how (Extremely wonky nasal nerd voice) "politics used to be moooorrreeee poollliitte we neeeeed a return to The Discouuurrrse."
rs-327	I'm sure I forgot a couple.
rs-328	Will he be so much beter that hes worth more than Kinlaw and the player(s) that we pick from the extra picks we get?
rs-328	OT could be there like Thomas but Im just not convinced any guy we take will be better than Little entering his 2nd year.
rs-328	He has health concerns atm but we also have Daley entering his 2nd year and is a decent safety net.
rs-328	Interior oline I think is a major problem but there is no Nelson like prospects that are going in the top 10.
rs-328	Edge might be a need depending on FA and the Iowa guy (can not spell his name) is good but that's still a bit of a reach.
rs-328	If we do not resign Bradberry and Okudah is there that really the only situation I absolutely stay put.
rs-329	2mo ago I bought a cheap '95 nissan truck, I was only locally driving so it took the better part of a week to realize I couldn't put it to 60mph, or that I had to floor it to hit 3500 rpm
rs-329	(although it has a little transmission-slippage from 1st to 2nd **only** when dead-cold, this problem is the engine for sure as I can't rev it past 3k in my driveway w/o feeling like I'm going to break something, I can only get the 3500 rpm when driving and flooring it, it'll hit close-to 3500 right before gear-shifts) I was trying to methodically rule-out what could be causing this power-sap, IE is it the air/fuel or a clogged cat/exhaust/etc or something entirely different?
rs-329	I ruled-out 'different', I think, by seeing that it will roll down-hill just fine in Neutral, so no mechanical interferences.
rs-330	Hey!
rs-330	Read somewhere that it can ruin his puppy teeth and small parts can be dangeroes, is it safe to give him a bone?
rs-330	They are pretty big, almost his size.
rs-331	Can I give my 2mo boston terrier puppy raw beef bones?
rs-332	[HELP] My puppy has suddenly refuaed to poop anywhere except inside
rs-333	friends think she said that cuz she was w her new man and she needed me to not blow her phone up etc. others think its a way for her to be evil, like think of me cuz im never coming to get that charm.
rs-333	i think its some type of hoover, good or bad.
rs-333	any insight is appreciated.
rs-333	if your a woman please tell me your perspective.
rs-333	so confused, bt she is clearly w someone else and why she couldnt call me back and why she didnt respond to my txt msgs.
rs-333	she couldve said im w my bf please dont call me bt she didnt.
rs-334	Just a side note: my bf and i are buying a house.we
rs-334	will be moving out in 2mo.
rs-334	Once the papers are all finalzed.
rs-334	I have an Australian shepherd 9mo.
rs-334	My bf (24m) and i (25f) got her at 3 mo.
rs-334	We take her on play dates every other week.
rs-334	She has a pair of dogs she likes to play tag with a black lab and a dog small dog that is a mix of something.
rs-334	We take her to see a rat terrier.
rs-334	Thier play style is boxing.
rs-334	And one of my roomates (25m) has a beagle.
rs-334	He doesnt like to play much infact he seems kinda scared too.
rs-335	i know all of these things about my dog.
rs-335	i know that it doesn't matter if your dog is friendly, aggressive, or otherwise; doesn't matter if your dog is already barking and growling, or just minding its own business; what matters is that my dog is nervous -- so when i hold my hand out and tell you, no, he's not sitting or lying down because he's calmly waiting for you to say hi, it's because he's nervous and insecure, i DON'T mean it as a joke, and it's NOT an invitation for you to say, "AW WELL MY DOG/CHILD IS VERY FRIENDLY SO LET ME APPROACH!"
rs-335	i don't care if your dog/child is friendly or "dog savvy".
rs-335	i don't care if your dog "is just a puppy" (why the hell is that even relevant? is my dog not allowed to be nervous around other puppies? ??????).
rs-335	i don't care if your child is capable of not screeching "OMG A PUPPYYYYYYY".
rs-336	can you, y'know, DO something about your child? and also your dog?
rs-337	But with less than 3mo to go for that i feel I'm not ready yet but having never taken it I have nothing to compare it to besides collegues advice.
rs-337	Without knowing what I know they can't know if I'm actually ready yet but many of them are pushing me to sign up for it.
rs-337	I want this...bad...amd it would be awesome to be done 6 mo from my intro exam.
rs-337	I'm close...
rs-337	I just don't know if I'm 2mo study close.
rs-338	Somm certified advice
rs-339	(M/5'10"/26/165-195lbs) 2mo progress, gaining too much weight?
rs-340	I know this sounds weird but heres my issue, about 4 months ago i had an 3700X which died after start crashing when i tried to play games and a day later not booting, send to rma, they confirmed the cpu was dead and gave my money back after 2mo, after that i got an 3800X, as soon as i tried got the boot code 7b everything power up but no reboots or video signal, send to rma this time with the store after 1mo they confirmed the cpu was falty send me a new one, i got the new one yesterday, same issue.
rs-341	My mom(T) has always been the type where her feelings matter 1st + only.
rs-341	If something she does is wrong, she manipulates it into being someone elses fault entirely.
rs-341	Ex: I needed some1 to babysit our then 2mo for 3-4 hrs.
rs-341	Dads work had som1 who had COVID, we opted out of them watching our son + askd my sister.
rs-341	I approached this topic as usual with T by trying to talk to her *before* I set it all up b/c I knew it would upset her.
rs-341	T got her hopes up, then its *my fault* \+
rs-341	she tried getting me to apologize for getting her hopes up.
rs-341	I talked to her *days* after the incident b/c she didnt call me after hanging up on me, told her how I felt about the whole thing, T promptly got off the phone, I nvr got an apology.
rs-341	B still thinks I am owed an apology, other things have happened since then due to Ts narcissism.
rs-341	I dont expect an apology from T b/c she **nvr** has once ever apologized for anything she’s ever done wrong.
rs-342	WIBTA for keeping our house in the divorce so I can rent out the other rooms?
rs-343	My EBF son is 5.5mo, 75th percentile weight and ahead in most milestones.

rs-343	We have all the bad habits - including nurse to sleep and nurse to nap, yes, the entire nap.
rs-343	I've been sleeping 1-2 hour intervals for what feels like forever.
rs-344	TLDR: tips/support to get 2mo baby sleeping beyond one sleep cycle in bassinet (Currently replacing pacifier every hour) FTM to a sweet 2 month old girl and I’m finding any progress we’ve made with sleeping is gone.

rs-346	So i already have an orange golden chinchilla ( toto - 2mo old) and we have had toto for 3 weeks now and felt she needed company, so we got terri (2 mo himalayan ragdoll) too keep eachother company.
rs-346	Its only been a few hours and she feels very sleepy, but when we pet her she sounds like a running car motor?
rs-346	just always goin "bRRrrRRrrRRrr".
rs-346	Im not sure if she has a blocked nose because toto, never made this kind of sound....
rs-346	Am I just being paranoid?

rs-352	I genually don't understand how "toxic" behavior is more pusished than literally int or troll.
rs-352	Well I've had an account which always recieved those rewards for being friendly or sportsmanlike until i got in a bad streak of losses in ranked and in a longer run my account got chat restricted.
rs-352	Then I read some of the things that had been marked as toxic behavior....
rs-352	And most of it were arguments.
rs-352	The bot that searches your in game chat for toxic behvaiour after a report doesn't understand the context.

rs-382	Pogo will not open for me keeps saying this device os blahh blahh blahhh u guys know what I'm talking bout anyway to fix this I am on android 6.0 b4 security update and in have root with magisk 16.0
rs-383	Personally, I think VII was (alongside RB1) the best Neps games in the entire franchise,what with having an storyline that doesn come off as too edgy nor melodramatic like Mk2/RB2, but neither as Over-the-top like V/RB3, having the exact and neccesary amount of seriousness and comedy, the characters got much better developed, and everyone (specially Vert,Nepgear and the Twins) got their own time to shine and of course, it proves that the events dont always have to rely on Neptune presence.
rs-384	Gr8 b8, m8.
rs-384	I rel8, str8 appreci8, and congratul8.

rs-385	ive taken quite a few of these classes as a physics major for my electives... and I will take NO MORE.
rs-385	They go up to the board and just starting writing math: meh, ok, thats fine.
rs-385	They then use shit like A sub 1 through A sub 20 for variables.
rs-385	infact, i have a linear algebra book that did this... A's FOR EVERYTHING.
rs-385	the pages were just matrices filled with A's.
rs-385	JUST DRAW A WEIRD SHAPE OR SOMETHING- ANYTHING BUT THAT ISH!
rs-386	Scariest thing 3ver m8
rs-387	Well,well here we are again frustrated, angry in front of my phone what a neat way to start isnt it?All of ya readers are my theraphie and i dont ow you a cent perfect right?If you are like me you are probably not going to read it all cause of your short attention span so lets keep it short(what a genius way to write after a long introduction saying "keep it short im a genius ain't i?")Well a tryed explaining to my budds that porn is kinda shaby and yeah just bad and u know who listened.......
rs-388	Hey,I just want to know what games can I run on this PC and witch nota.
rs-389	I was a spy and on the first night I was jailed and I proudly told jailor my role.
rs-389	I also got attacked whilst in jail.
rs-389	When day 2 had begun, mafia and sk had made their kills.
rs-389	I proudly said: "I was attacked while in jail!", wrong move.
rs-389	Jailor decides to jail me again and ask me "You were attacked while you were in jail?" and I answer "yes m8".
rs-389	He then tells me that what I am saying is bs because sk and maf have already made their kills.
rs-389	Then he executes me.
rs-389	Seriously!?
rs-390	Oh boi u 2 dum for da movie boi, da director wuz like shieeet itz bout da hiden meaningz u have 2 find boi, lyke u kno it duznt spoonfeed ya da film ya kno?
rs-390	Like shieet y it gotta explain m8, just imagine what happened ya know?
rs-390	It's no like I pretend it has a deeper meaning than what it has ya kno?
rs-391	yet when fully charged for the 1st 30-60 minutes, it's always on! which is beaaaautiful!
rs-391	Lastly, if i do not use the Smok Alien for an extended amount of time (say at night when sleeping) the battery reduces when left in the mod and the mod is turned off?
rs-391	wtf m8?
rs-391	I just want to understand if all of this is the same for everyone?
rs-391	or is it just me?
rs-391	in searching google i cannot find an answer to any of these questions.
rs-391	Other than these issues i am really enjoying the mod.
rs-391	its just a fuckin' ball ache every single time i want to vape to have to wait for the fucking thing to go through its motions before i can puff...
rs-392	Everytime i log on i want to chill afk nmz and play xbox and be fat right but, lately i log on play rs afk for like 20secs and i get logged out and its fucking annoying is it my Internet connection or is it the servers or what its pissin me off m8
rs-393	Next we have my Stats class and I didn't realize that we had additional homework to do online as well as the written homework and so my grade was a 70 something and then I bombed my final for it because of some family emergency that popped up involving my uncle and a car in a hit and run.
rs-393	So then my Band class is basically easy A as it's show up to a weekly practice and go to the one concert and so I passed that gg ez m8.
rs-394	Dramatic death scenes and bringing the characters back with a gag do NOT go hand in hand.
rs-395	So I finally got to Blighttown, and was strolling about, minding my business, and a sniper started throwing darts at me.
rs-395	So I was like "wtf m8?" and hid behind some destructible wood.
rs-395	After a certain time, he stopped attacking, so I showed myself and he reappeared, and started with the darts again.
rs-395	So a couple dozen darts after I simply get +500 souls, and that purple moss stuff.
rs-395	So what the hell happened there, did the motherfucker just kill himself in shame or what, he simply died all of the sudden?
rs-396	This years rookie game is actually going to be real exciting, wt line ups u wanna see
rs-397	I love this Show but sadly I’m near to finish it already, how is this called and are there other movies or shows based on this really special kind of story ?
rs-397	I NEVER wt ch movies or so sorry about my mack of vocabulary on this tho, is this called distopian ?
rs-397	Well I’m really lost but I just want some other stuff like this to watch, it’s crazy !
rs-398	Has it happened to anyone else?happened to me number of times
rs-399	So if you're on leg 2 , you have to win 10 consecutive games for the xp and coins , 10 stamina for 40 tickets , get the fuck outta here EA!!!
rs-400	But now it just doesnt make sence, you only get 1 ticket per match and if you are lucky you will get 10 extra in every 20 matches.
rs-400	Only in leg or WC 1.
rs-400	This tournament was the 1 thing F2p was always abble to do because of the low cost of entrence and the rewards where good enough compared to how many matches you need to play.
rs-400	You got a player extra and if you didnt like him.
rs-400	Use it as XP.
rs-401	[Suggestion] if you dont like the new WT than dont play it.
rs-402	Closed tech support?
rs-402	It's 1:30am and you're a billion-dollar, global enterprise.
rs-402	WT-literal-F?
rs-402	Was your heating bill too much this month so you can't make your rent?
rs-402	You mismanaged bunch of fools.
rs-403	So long story short, I forgot to fill out the housing application for the fall 22 semester and i’m on the waitlist since April.
rs-403	Housing isn’t guaranteed when ur not a freshman and my income isn’t enough for rent sooo there’s a possibility i might be homeless
rs-404	My answer is simple: Have you seen the men nowadays?
rs-404	No.
rs-404	Fking.
rs-404	Competition.
rs-404	Most men this day are thirsty af.
rs-404	The era of gentlemen is over.
rs-404	They are either idiots, look like a half assed rapper or are complete assholes.
rs-404	Often times all of that.
rs-404	In their primitive brains they grab and grunt at everything with 2 legs.
rs-404	And i mean that literally.
rs-404	BUT – thats good for you.
rs-404	If you just behave like a decent human being, then you are already better than 80% of the other dudes.

rs-420	Tbh thooo this wasn't my priority program, so ofc I had mixed emotions.
rs-420	I was elated to finally be an iska but I was also worried bcos I'm not rlly as interested in Bio as invested I already was in PT.
rs-420	Sure I could learn to love bio, sure I could transfer to UPM the next year but that's not certain.

rs-432	VACUUM WONT STOP SUCKING PLEASE SEND HELP, IS IT GONNA BLOW?
rs-433	Basically if you didn’t know what that is,it’s basically an example of two sentences.
rs-433	One says “Lets eat granny” making it seem like someone’s gonna eat their nan.
rs-433	However,the other example says “Lets eat,granny” implying a different meaning to the sentence.
rs-433	Pretty creative way to teach kids to use commas ig.
rs-434	I literally couldn't have been more at fault just drove straight into this woman's golf while changing lanes (it was raining and I did not see it) she seemed nice but understandably pissed.
rs-434	She took my insurance and my number and said it's my choice if I want to go through insurance and she would call me.

rs-438	lol - small acknowledgement of a joke you sort of enjoyed but didn't actually laugh
rs-438	LOL - adults and people who don't really know how the internet works use this
rs-438	Lol - not sure why this came up but it's likely an autocorrect but if anyone types this on purpose they are probably a huge dweeb.
rs-438	Business-
rs-438	lol is what it has been named
rs-438	LoL - grandma lol, confused with lots of love.
rs-438	also confusing because of league of legends.
rs-438	looooooooool - now, i think my gf pronounces this but she says that this one would rhyme with "spool" but i think it's the drawn out "o".
rs-438	So yeah, i think this is actual lols, she thinks it doesn't exist.
rs-438	lollllllllllllll - when i hear her say "loooool", this is what she says she is actually saying.
rs-438	I sort of get it.
rs-438	but i still think that's "loooooool", you can't repeatedly pronounce a consonant
rs-439	So, when is big Ben going to bong again?
