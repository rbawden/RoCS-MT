I know there are veteran souls out there that just waded through things and knew what to look for and didn't have to die 50 times trying to figure if mob xxx's yyy attack was un-parry-able.\n\nWhat are good learning spots to nail down timing, be it parry, dodge, or block? Thus far whenever I feel like practicing I load into cemetery of ash and just practice parrying the low guys, or the first lothric knight you find.\n\nSorry for the long post, i'm just excited to give this game another go; I've always enjoyed the concept of dark souls.\n\nThanks in advance for replies!";New-ish player, couple of questions about parrying, etc;New-ish player, couple of questions about parrying, etc.;Relativně nový hráč, několik dotazů k ohánění mečem atd.;"Context: video game

32;9;7;text;[TOMT] [SONG] Song that sounds a bit like Coldplay, chorus draws out every 4th word;"https://vocaroo.com/i/s1a32Fb6RPUt Sorry, not a singer lol. I've been looking for this for days. I think I remember it sounding kind of like Coldplay, with a male singer, but I've listened to a lot of their music in my search with no luck, so I'm not sure if it's them. It may be an older song. The part I'm humming is like ""word word word wo-o-o-ord"" x2. So he draws out the 4th (?) word. I think it was something like ""fly-y-y-yyy."" I'm pretty sure it's a popular song, I've heard it many times. Thanks!";Thanks!;Thanks!;Díky!;;;FALSE
33;10;8;title;Having trouble with if / then / else / end in a repeat loop.;"Hey all   \n  \nFairly new to scripting with applescript, and have run into an issue and would love some suggestions on how to get past it.  \nThe essence of the problem is that I'm checking for location of a button in a UI that won't let me script it.  So what I do is take a small screenshot with screencapture -Rxxx,yyy,xdimension,ydimension and compare it to a known good image. This part is easy and works no problem.  \nThe trouble I'm having is efficiently figuring out which of 4 locations this button is in and then acting upon that info.  If it's not in the first two locations I need to simulate a mouse click and move on to the next two locations.  \n  \n\nI was trying something like :  \n  \n    repeat x times  \n        set VAR1 to do shell script ""check/image.sh""   \n        set VAR2 to do shell script ""check/image2.sh""   \n        -- etc  \n        -- then this is where I'm currently stuck  \n        if VAR1 is ""success"" then do shell script ""click here and here""  \n        else if VAR2 is ""success"" then do shell script ""click here2 and here2""  \n        -- if it's not either of those two, I have to simulate the click to the next two locations  \n        else do shell script ""click here3 and here3""  \n        end if  \n        if VAR3 is ""success"" then do shell script ""click here4 and here4""  \n        else if VAR4 is ""success"" then do shell script ""click here5 and here5.sh""  \n        else echo ""nope not found""  \n    end repeat  \n  \nTo me this seems bad and quite inefficient, I'd like it to be able to check if a location is the right one, then click on that location and then exit the loop, but I don't seem to be able to get it to do that.  The way I have it now is that say VAR1 is the correct location, it'll still go through the rest even tho we know they will be wrong.  \nIs there a better way of doing this, have I gone completely off track and overlooked something simple?  \nCan I exit repeat after it finds the correct location (and after it runs the shell script)?";Having trouble with if / then / else / end in a repeat loop.;I’m having trouble with if / then / else / end in a repeat loop.;Mám problém s příkazy if / then / else / end ve smyčce opakování.;if / then / else / end = conditional structure in programming, so should be kept in English.;;TRUE

54;16;13;text;Why some like the Undead and why more love them.;"*Ok, so i this is obviosly my first time posting OC.*\n\n*In fact i wrote this in my off time from work and with a couple of beers into writing i thoght i'd post it on reddit since i remembered i read most hfy stories here i thoght i'd give it a try.*\n\n*I mean i opened this accound somewhat 30 ago. In that time i read over it one last time since i finaly realized posting it would mean other people will be able to see my failures grammer wise......... and obviusly all the other ones.*\n\n*But never the less, let me have it. You're welcome to post critic and most of all:*\n\nthanks for reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee, the best thing I ever got to taste myself, well how do you put it -that wasn't poisoned-,\n\nwas Dwarfen Ale; and I had to lick that from stone paving mind you. For the entertainment of others \n\nand still it was the best thing I ever got to taste.\n\nMakes one wonder. Was the Ale that breathakingly delicious or does my life just so happen to be extra shitty.\n\nThere's more than enough people in this place I could compare myself to. Sadly the truth is that I care very little \n\nfor them. I should practice more empathy you say?\n\nFirst, of all let me politely tell you to go fuck yourself! I can't seem to find the wisdom as to why \n\nsomeone that is slurping Dwarfen Ale directly from the sidewalk should be even reasonably well at showing empathy!\n\nSecondly, especially when said person is being forced to do so! TO BE THE LAUGHING STOCK FOR OTHERS!\n\n\n\nBreath, breath calmly and enjoy the Ale. As things stand I'm never going to get to even afford Dwarfen Ale.\n\nLet's think of me sampling this Dwarfen Goodness off the ground for others joy as my payment for this treat.\n\nYes, let's just do that.\n\nJust that.\n\nNothing more.\n\nI am a sane person, with a realistic outlook on life.\n\nJup, Jup.\n\nThat's the good stuff.\n\nRich in mana and all.\n\nJada, jada. Just keep on the act.\n\n\n\nMy fortune must be quite good. I meen what are the chances of me turning the corner and bumping into the \n\nFUCKING FIRST GUARD CAPTAIN. I am nothing but certain that the Gods must love me, since one can hardly argue\n\nthe odds of running into the one person in this whole meatgrinder of a city that loves alcohol more than \n\nthe poor homeless man that stumbled into them and let them drop their bottle of golden happiness.\n\nBut lucky for me it was Ale brewed by Dwarfs. Even better for me it would be: It would be an unbeleafable loss to let\n\na broken an thus spilt bottle be wasted with no return.\n\n\n\nSo to show my sincerest appologies for bumping staight into a nobel that half marched in his drunken stupor, down\n\nthe sidewalk, straight out of a likor store and making him drop his bottle worth more than what I suppose one of the\n\nmerchants off the mainsteet makes in a month, I was offerd to finish the wasted goods, less they spoil any further.\n\nOf the cobblestone. Filth, minor shards and all. \n\n\n\nAs I was about to finish my treat, I got hit in the head with a boot.\n\n\n\n""Be thankfull for my generous treatment! Never in your life would waste like you ever have gotten to taste \n\nsuch an costly baverage!""\n\n\n\n""Y-y-yyy-yes sire! May the heavens cry before your mercyfull heart!""\n\n\n\n""Now get lost! This is no place for desease ridden vermin like you.""\n\n\n\n""O-off course my lord!""\n\n\n\nI ran. Back down the alley I squirmed my way out of. Filled to the brim with anger and shame.\n\nSidestreets and alleyways, down I went. Further and furhter out of sight. The very rout where less and less peoble\n\nwent. I hate to admit that I'm vermin, but can you guess what vermin is best at?\n\nNot dying and knowing the way home; and home I ran.\n\n\n\nSadly when I was reaching home my fear and panick clearly showed on my face. I was welcomed by far to many\n\nquestioning looks, happy as they seem to be to see my face. That happy expressoin was not ment to last. I know there is\n\nbut one reason behind seeing me again that quickly, but one reason I was not ment to fulfill.\n\nWith all these watchfull eyes on me, I would not dare to sneak away into the shadows. I answered truthfully.\n\n\n\n""I'm sorry.""\n\n\n\nI had nothing more to say, as my view began to tunnel. Looking at nothing else but the ground underneath wich\n\nthese people have decided to build their home. Besides the sewers are much like a cave, you see.\n\nTemperatur stays mainly the same around the year, even if the smell is terrible.\n\nBut not many of these ""settlers of the urban frontier"" would spare one second on the thoght of smell.\n\nThat I came back empty handed, on the other hand, did matter. Gravely.\n\nEspecially since others seem to be catching a wift of the odor I have carried with me to the underground.\n\nBreath and stains that most who have been up above would associate with places with plenty of alcohol.\n\n\n\n""Ya worthless piece of shit!

In that time i read over it one last time since i finaly realized posting it would mean other people will be able to see my failures grammer wise......... and obviusly all the other ones.*\n\n*But never the less, let me have it. You're welcome to post critic and most of all:*\n\nthanks for reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee, the best thing I ever got to taste myself, well how do you put it -that wasn't poisoned-,\n\nwas Dwarfen Ale; and I had to lick that from stone paving mind you. For the entertainment of others \n\nand still it was the best thing I ever got to taste.\n\nMakes one wonder. Was the Ale that breathakingly delicious or does my life just so happen to be extra shitty.\n\nThere's more than enough people in this place I could compare myself to. Sadly the truth is that I care very little \n\nfor them. I should practice more empathy you say?\n\nFirst, of all let me politely tell you to go fuck yourself! I can't seem to find the wisdom as to why \n\nsomeone that is slurping Dwarfen Ale directly from the sidewalk should be even reasonably well at showing empathy!\n\nSecondly, especially when said person is being forced to do so! TO BE THE LAUGHING STOCK FOR OTHERS!\n\n\n\nBreath, breath calmly and enjoy the Ale. As things stand I'm never going to get to even afford Dwarfen Ale.\n\nLet's think of me sampling this Dwarfen Goodness off the ground for others joy as my payment for this treat.\n\nYes, let's just do that.\n\nJust that.\n\nNothing more.\n\nI am a sane person, with a realistic outlook on life.\n\nJup, Jup.\n\nThat's the good stuff.\n\nRich in mana and all.\n\nJada, jada. Just keep on the act.\n\n\n\nMy fortune must be quite good. I meen what are the chances of me turning the corner and bumping into the \n\nFUCKING FIRST GUARD CAPTAIN. I am nothing but certain that the Gods must love me, since one can hardly argue\n\nthe odds of running into the one person in this whole meatgrinder of a city that loves alcohol more than \n\nthe poor homeless man that stumbled into them and let them drop their bottle of golden happiness.\n\nBut lucky for me it was Ale brewed by Dwarfs. Even better for me it would be: It would be an unbeleafable loss to let\n\na broken an thus spilt bottle be wasted with no return.\n\n\n\nSo to show my sincerest appologies for bumping staight into a nobel that half marched in his drunken stupor, down\n\nthe sidewalk, straight out of a likor store and making him drop his bottle worth more than what I suppose one of the\n\nmerchants off the mainsteet makes in a month, I was offerd to finish the wasted goods, less they spoil any further.\n\nOf the cobblestone. Filth, minor shards and all. \n\n\n\nAs I was about to finish my treat, I got hit in the head with a boot.\n\n\n\n""Be thankfull for my generous treatment! Never in your life would waste like you ever have gotten to taste \n\nsuch an costly baverage!""\n\n\n\n""Y-y-yyy-yes sire! May the heavens cry before your mercyfull heart!""\n\n\n\n""Now get lost!

Filled to the brim with anger and shame.\n\nSidestreets and alleyways, down I went. Further and furhter out of sight. The very rout where less and less peoble\n\nwent. I hate to admit that I'm vermin, but can you guess what vermin is best at?\n\nNot dying and knowing the way home; and home I ran.\n\n\n\nSadly when I was reaching home my fear and panick clearly showed on my face. I was welcomed by far to many\n\nquestioning looks, happy as they seem to be to see my face. That happy expressoin was not ment to last. I know there is\n\nbut one reason behind seeing me again that quickly, but one reason I was not ment to fulfill.\n\nWith all these watchfull eyes on me, I would not dare to sneak away into the shadows. I answered truthfully.\n\n\n\n""I'm sorry.""\n\n\n\nI had nothing more to say, as my view began to tunnel. Looking at nothing else but the ground underneath wich\n\nthese people have decided to build their home. Besides the sewers are much like a cave, you see.\n\nTemperatur stays mainly the same around the year, even if the smell is terrible.\n\nBut not many of these ""settlers of the urban frontier"" would spare one second on the thoght of smell.\n\nThat I came back empty handed, on the other hand, did matter. Gravely.\n\nEspecially since others seem to be catching a wift of the odor I have carried with me to the underground.\n\nBreath and stains that most who have been up above would associate with places with plenty of alcohol.\n\n\n\n""Ya worthless piece of shit!

For the entertainment of others \n\nand still it was the best thing I ever got to taste.\n\nMakes one wonder. Was the Ale that breathakingly delicious or does my life just so happen to be extra shitty.\n\nThere's more than enough people in this place I could compare myself to. Sadly the truth is that I care very little \n\nfor them. I should practice more empathy you say?\n\nFirst, of all let me politely tell you to go fuck yourself! I can't seem to find the wisdom as to why \n\nsomeone that is slurping Dwarfen Ale directly from the sidewalk should be even reasonably well at showing empathy!\n\nSecondly, especially when said person is being forced to do so! TO BE THE LAUGHING STOCK FOR OTHERS!\n\n\n\nBreath, breath calmly and enjoy the Ale. As things stand I'm never going to get to even afford Dwarfen Ale.\n\nLet's think of me sampling this Dwarfen Goodness off the ground for others joy as my payment for this treat.\n\nYes, let's just do that.\n\nJust that.\n\nNothing more.\n\nI am a sane person, with a realistic outlook on life.\n\nJup, Jup.\n\nThat's the good stuff.\n\nRich in mana and all.\n\nJada, jada. Just keep on the act.\n\n\n\nMy fortune must be quite good. I meen what are the chances of me turning the corner and bumping into the \n\nFUCKING FIRST GUARD CAPTAIN.

I hate to admit that I'm vermin, but can you guess what vermin is best at?\n\nNot dying and knowing the way home; and home I ran.\n\n\n\nSadly when I was reaching home my fear and panick clearly showed on my face.

TO BE THE LAUGHING STOCK FOR OTHERS!\n\n\n\nBreath, breath calmly and enjoy the Ale. As things stand I'm never going to get to even afford Dwarfen Ale.\n\nLet's think of me sampling this Dwarfen Goodness off the ground for others joy as my payment for this treat.\n\nYes, let's just do that.\n\nJust that.\n\nNothing more.\n\nI am a sane person, with a realistic outlook on life.\n\nJup, Jup.\n\nThat's the good stuff.\n\nRich in mana and all.\n\nJada, jada. Just keep on the act.\n\n\n\nMy fortune must be quite good. I meen what are the chances of me turning the corner and bumping into the \n\nFUCKING FIRST GUARD CAPTAIN.

I hate to admit that I'm vermin, but can you guess what vermin is best at?\n\nNot dying and knowing the way home; and home I ran.\n\n\n\nSadly when I was reaching home my fear and panick clearly showed on my face. I was welcomed by far to many\n\nquestioning looks, happy as they seem to be to see my face. That happy expressoin was not ment to last. I know there is\n\nbut one reason behind seeing me again that quickly, but one reason I was not ment to fulfill.\n\nWith all these watchfull eyes on me, I would not dare to sneak away into the shadows. I answered truthfully.\n\n\n\n""I'm sorry.""\n\n\n\nI had nothing more to say, as my view began to tunnel. Looking at nothing else but the ground underneath wich\n\nthese people have decided to build their home. Besides the sewers are much like a cave, you see.\n\nTemperatur stays mainly the same around the year, even if the smell is terrible.\n\nBut not many of these ""settlers of the urban frontier"" would spare one second on the thoght of smell.\n\nThat I came back empty handed, on the other hand, did matter. Gravely.\n\nEspecially since others seem to be catching a wift of the odor I have carried with me to the underground.\n\nBreath and stains that most who have been up above would associate with places with plenty of alcohol.\n\n\n\n""Ya worthless piece of shit!

In quite creative ways at that!\n\nWell just one creative way for just one leg, but it hurt like hell. \n\nThe first leg on the other hand was surpringly unimaginitiv. \n\nMake the traitor trip, push the back to the floor as hard as you can and stompt the right knee with as much as two \n\ndickheads until you hear the disgrace scream.\n\nMagical.\n\nSecond leg was the real kicker, excuse the pun. They'd bind me to a bridge over the sewer. Legs with your calfs in\n\nthe stream. It's like they would plan for shit like this to go down.\n\nUpper body? Can't move.\n\nLower body including your upper leg? No movement possible\n\nYou lower legs? Movement very possible, encuraged even.\n\nThing is. You're looking downstream and can bend only the lower part of your leg upstream at the knee.\n\n\n\nCan you guess where I'm going with this?\n\n\n\n""Since when do sewer-hobos have time, energie and resorces to torture just for smelling alcohol!\n\nSINCE WHEN DO YOU REATARDS HAVE STUFF FOR ANYTHING!!!!""\n\n\n\n""Wow, took us long enough, but finaly we got some big emotions, some motivation. Ya hear that folks!? Wouldn't that\n\nvigor have been put to great use to get some food or whatever!?""\n\n""YOU ASSHOLES!!!!""\n\n\n\n""Scream all ye want, but let us 'ave some entertainment.

LET'S GET AT LEAST A BIT BACK FROM THIS SUCKER BOYS!""\n\n\n\nI could almost emidiatly hear the splashig from behind me. Didn't take me long to figure out they threw all kinds\n\nof stuff into the stream to hit my legs dangling in the water. \n\nFirst confirmation to my wild theory here? A plank to my right leg. \n\nYES THE ONE WITH THE FUCKING BROKEN KNEE!!!\n\nI almost fainted from the pain. I most sertenly wet myself from it, not that anybody cared.\n\nOne they wanted me in pain.\n\nTwo I already dangled in a literal shitstream!\n\n\n\nThe show didn't just end with my left knee being broken via the conectet leg being hit from behind.\n\nNo that was what I was expexting. They did aaaaaall of that just so I coudn't see when and if something would hit me,\n\nor which leg it was, or both. Letting me guess wenn my right leg would be struck and I would feel the hit.\n\nFirst a sharp pain, from the knee up to my hip, further up my spine and finaly up to my neck, where I would first\n\nshiver, then sob and then howl in pain as my knee bend in a way it was not ment to.\n\nThat was until, well I had two broken legs...\n\n\n\nI had no more than my literal shit eating grin as my parting farewell to them as they threw me in their river of \n\nwaste with my broken legs to send me off.\n\n\n\nWith still flailing arms I was still sure to sink and steadily, I was send downstream, where with sertanty my \n\nfriends and teachers would pick me up. And that far quicker than I could ever hope.\n\n\n\nAt the very bottom of the sea, mearly a couple hours of walking distance away from the place I had been \n\ntortured and thrown into this mixture of fecies and water I was recieved in the most familiar fashion.\n\n\n\n""We welcome you back dear friend. I see on your smile, that coming to pick you up was not a futile endevour.\n\nWhat gifts do bring for us? What have you learned? But first let us bring you ashore.""\n\n\n\nThus began our ascend. Fast but steadily, always carefull not to drop me.\n\n\n\n""I see the meat you carry even if neither alive nor any longer usefull has been tendet to in most unfathomable\n\nways.

I hate to admit that I'm vermin, but can you guess what vermin is best at?\n\nNot dying and knowing the way home; and home I ran.\n\n\n\nSadly when I was reaching home my fear and panick clearly showed on my face. I was welcomed by far to many\n\nquestioning looks, happy as they seem to be to see my face. That happy expressoin was not ment to last. I know there is\n\nbut one reason behind seeing me again that quickly, but one reason I was not ment to fulfill.\n\nWith all these watchfull eyes on me, I would not dare to sneak away into the shadows. I answered truthfully.\n\n\n\n""I'm sorry.""\n\n\n\nI had nothing more to say, as my view began to tunnel. Looking at nothing else but the ground underneath wich\n\nthese people have decided to build their home. Besides the sewers are much like a cave, you see.\n\nTemperatur stays mainly the same around the year, even if the smell is terrible.\n\nBut not many of these ""settlers of the urban frontier"" would spare one second on the thoght of smell.\n\nThat I came back empty handed, on the other hand, did matter. Gravely.\n\nEspecially since others seem to be catching a wift of the odor I have carried with me to the underground.\n\nBreath and stains that most who have been up above would associate with places with plenty of alcohol.\n\n\n\n""Ya worthless piece of shit! To think ye would even dare to return here in your sorry state!!!\n\nNot only did'ya come back with nothing, but even in this shitfest of a settlement yer bin' drinkin' booze!\n\nAnd not only that, you didn't even share!!!!!!\n\n\n\n""No... that I can expla-""\n\n\n\n""Shut your whore mouth! It's not that ya return home stinkin' of alcohol, you rotten cunt couldn't even wait \n\nto return to us to share.... or worse, didn't want to...""\n\n\n\n""Please... I beg you...""\n\n\n\n""No. No, fuck off. It takes a special kind of bastard ta betray those who rely upon each other simply for their own\n\npleasure. You know what, we're no hartless people. We're simpe folks. Grab that fuck!\n\nYa get you's just desert after mooching of off us, but we'll let ya live. \n\nBreak thems legs, both of 'em and through the traitor in the sewer!\n\n\n\n""No! Please! By the Gods! Let me explain!""\n\n\n\nNow, where do you run to when a whole mob of angry sewer-hobos are comming for you because you smell like beer, \n\nwon't let you explain and have nothing to show for it, in their sewers.\n\nRight no where.\n\nI was cought in no time and just as promised got may legs cruely broken. In quite creative ways at that!\n\nWell just one creative way for just one leg, but it hurt like hell. \n\nThe first leg on the other hand was surpringly unimaginitiv. \n\nMake the traitor trip, push the back to the floor as hard as you can and stompt the right knee with as much as two \n\ndickheads until you hear the disgrace scream.\n\nMagical.\n\nSecond leg was the real kicker, excuse the pun. They'd bind me to a bridge over the sewer. Legs with your calfs in\n\nthe stream. It's like they would plan for shit like this to go down.\n\nUpper body? Can't move.\n\nLower body including your upper leg? No movement possible\n\nYou lower legs? Movement very possible, encuraged even.\n\nThing is. You're looking downstream and can bend only the lower part of your leg upstream at the knee.\n\n\n\nCan you guess where I'm going with this?\n\n\n\n""Since when do sewer-hobos have time, energie and resorces to torture just for smelling alcohol!\n\nSINCE WHEN DO YOU REATARDS HAVE STUFF FOR ANYTHING!!!!""\n\n\n\n""Wow, took us long enough, but finaly we got some big emotions, some motivation. Ya hear that folks!? Wouldn't that\n\nvigor have been put to great use to get some food or whatever!?""\n\n""YOU ASSHOLES!!!!""\n\n\n\n""Scream all ye want, but let us 'ave some entertainment. Buahahahaahahaha! After all, ye cost us \n\nfood an' medicine we could've used for more usefull people. LET'S GET AT LEAST A BIT BACK FROM THIS SUCKER BOYS!""\n\n\n\nI could almost emidiatly hear the splashig from behind me. Didn't take me long to figure out they threw all kinds\n\nof stuff into the stream to hit my legs dangling in the water. \n\nFirst confirmation to my wild theory here? A plank to my right leg. \n\nYES THE ONE WITH THE FUCKING BROKEN KNEE!!!\n\nI almost fainted from the pain. I most sertenly wet myself from it, not that anybody cared.\n\nOne they wanted me in pain.\n\nTwo I already dangled in a literal shitstream!\n\n\n\nThe show didn't just end with my left knee being broken via the conectet leg being hit from behind.\n\nNo that was what I was expexting. They did aaaaaall of that just so I coudn't see when and if something would hit me,\n\nor which leg it was, or both. Letting me guess wenn my right leg would be struck and I would feel the hit.\n\nFirst a sharp pain, from the knee up to my hip, further up my spine and finaly up to my neck, where I would first\n\nshiver, then sob and then howl in pain as my knee bend in a way it was not ment to.\n\nThat was until, well I had two broken legs...\n\n\n\nI had no more than my literal shit eating grin as my parting farewell to them as they threw me in their river of \n\nwaste with my broken legs to send me off.\n\n\n\nWith still flailing arms I was still sure to sink and steadily, I was send downstream, where with sertanty my \n\nfriends and teachers would pick me up. And that far quicker than I could ever hope.\n\n\n\nAt the very bottom of the sea, mearly a couple hours of walking distance away from the place I had been \n\ntortured and thrown into this mixture of fecies and water I was recieved in the most familiar fashion.\n\n\n\n""We welcome you back dear friend. I see on your smile, that coming to pick you up was not a futile endevour.\n\nWhat gifts do bring for us? What have you learned? But first let us bring you ashore.""\n\n\n\nThus began our ascend. Fast but steadily, always carefull not to drop me.\n\n\n\n""I see the meat you carry even if neither alive nor any longer usefull has been tendet to in most unfathomable\n\nways. Never have i seen an undead as yourself. So bitterly clinging to your past as one of the living.\n\nRemember even the dead, if most slowly, can not evade change and thus must exept it.""\n\n\n\nAs I was finaly lowered softly on the soft sand of the beach, I began my retort.\n\n\n\n""Thank you for the warm welcome and your help out of this watery grave. I will keep your kind reminder and\n\nwil listen no further. If stagnation means death then I choose to keep staing unchanged.\n\nGifts I have none but my presence, but much did I lern from the living.""\n\n\n\nMy smile growing ever wider as I spoke.\n\n\n\n""As it seems, the higher ecchelons of this fine place do enjoy the finest of drinks. More so facinating is \n\nthe way to consume them! Indeed I myself did taste the finest of Ale direktly of the cobblestone in \n\nfront of a likor store that sells it. Serfed to me by the first Guard Captain Himself nonetheles!\n\nShards and filth and all! You should have seen the envy, heard the cheers of the bystanding croud! I could do\n\nno less than thank the Captain for his gracious hart for sharing his prosperity with a nobody like me.\n\nI could not stand myself after recieving his gratitude and ran as quick as I could back home to share this story\n\nwith my peers. But full of envy where they, for they could no longer join me in my decadence.\n\nAs such, overrun by anger from their envy I got my legs broken and was drowned.\n\nHow I wish I could share my expirience...""\n\n\n\n""The dead exist for a reason my friend. We remember the past long gone for we have lived it\n\nand walk among the living to make sure they will not forget. You may rest for now, while the rest of us\n\nwill do our duty. But please do pray tell, what kind of Ale do the living enjoy?""\n\n\n\n""I learned Dwarfen Ale is the best there is.

My guide: ""Ere the unambitious, \n\nThough they prevail'd against spawn, have lashed themselves.

Having said this,\n\nMy master: ""Hark! The sun sets."" and to an unoccupied cobblestone hut\n\nPointed, ""Go thou there and for the night stay, lest thee die to a mob.""\n\nHeeding his word, I rested in the house, but could not sleep for\n\nThere was no bed. Once it was day, I left and my\n\nMaster to me: ""Come, there is more to see.\n\nFollow me closely and hear my words.""\n\nI with him traveled for days until reaching an\n\nElaborate base. ""Fear not, none is home.\n\nThe place before thee was called Ziggy Town.\n\nLong before thou had ever heard of this world,\n\nA player, popbob he was known, by using means\n\nUnethical sought to preserve for himself a legacy.\n\nUsing backdoors, he was to obtain illegal items able,\n\nGiving to his friends bedrock and else,\n\nTrusting that whatever he built would last forver.

To me: ""This, as thou knowest, is a\n\nNether portal. Provide they access to the nether highways,\n\nThe principal server spanning mode of movement. Enter,\n\nAnd I will follow.""\n\nHarking his command, inside I stepp'd. On the other\n\nSide beheld I a labyrinth of paths carv'd through netherrack.\n\nMy guide: ""The nether highways are among the feats\n\nGreatest engineering every accomplished. Blast'd and\n\nMined in e'ery direction by thousands o'er the years.\n\nThough all depend on them to travel, \n\nSome are less respectful than o'ers.\n\nHide thyself!"" Before me out of a great crater in the path had appeared a \n\nLarge wither.

""Follow."" my master said.\n\nWith him traveling prolonged three days,\n\nUntil I what seemed like distorted hills beheld.\n\n""What is this? Wherefore comes it?"" I asked.\n\n""In legends, the Farlands, it is known."" my master respond'd.\n\n""They exist because of a generation error from the oldest\n\nVersions of this game, though many doubt they ever\n\nWere on this server.

I respond'd.\n\n""Those with the dedication to find it understand its\n\nBeauty and wond'r, and so told not a player of it. Thus,\n\nenjoyed by thee and others ever more it may be. Come,\n\nmore to see there be."" my guide said and return'd to the portal.\n\nOn the o'er side, he led through the maze of tunnels me until\n\nat another portal we arrived. ""Enter."" he bade me.\n\nOn the opposite side, I beheld the frame of an end portal. It\n\nhadn't a missing eye yet no portal proceed'd hence.\n\n""All end portals have been destroy'd."" my guide explain'd.\n\n""Or, all in strongholds. For to proceed to the final realm, one\n\nWith a backdoor must thou seek.

Before us a sign was.\n\n""High-quality illegal items available for a limited time only at\n\nFitMC's item emporium located at XXX YYY ZZZ in the Nether.\n\nPrices negotiated at sale."" (coordinates removed) its inscription ran.\n\n""Let's away."" my guide said.\n\nWe traveled for weeks until reaching the location. There FitMC my eyes\n\nBeheld, totem in hand. My guide to him: ""End."" ""25 totems, 25 crystals."" Fit\n\nRespond'd. ""Very well."" my guide said, procuring from a shulker the payment.\n\nFit handed to him the end portal frames. ""Come."" my guide said.\n\nWhen we were a far off, he plac'd them upon the ground and\n\nThem activat'd with the eyes. ""Step inside."" he bade me.\n\nWith reservation, I did so. On the other side I beheld\n\nAn endless starless void of twisting and spiral platforms\n\nStretching in e'ery direction.\n\n""This is the End."" my guide said.\n\n""It is the final destination of all 2b2t players.

He, soon as he saw\n\nThat I was weeping, answer'd, ""Come with me.""\n\nOnward he mov'd, I close his steps pursu'd. \n\nEnt'ring he led me with him on the bounds\n\nOf a great circle itself encirclign a great abyss.\n\nEre, I beheld an uneven land with lava pyramids cover'd,\n\nWith sickly farms of melons and carrots, near barren of life \n\nSave for those imprison'd in it, who, though they surrounded\n\nUs, dar'd not approach for fear of master.\n\nAs mine ear could note, the sound was heard of screams, \n\nCries, and explosions that made th' eternal air\n\nTremble, caus'd by slaughter, starvation, withering, and \n\nGrief felt by those multitudes, many and vast,\n\nOf men, women, and children. Then to me\n\nThe gentle guide: ""Inquir'st thou not what players\n\nAre these, which thou beholdest?  Ere thou pass\n\nFarther, I would thou know, that many of these of spawn\n\nWere blameless, yet here suffer since veterans they were not,\n\nThe portal to thy destination. For no other evil, \n\nThey are lost to endless hunger, fights, and\n\nSleepless nights, slaughter'd endlessly for the amusement of\n\nThose who before them came, freed only by slim chance;\n\nSo grief assail'd my heart at hearing this, for well I knew\n\nSuspended in that Limbo many a gamer\n\nOf mighty worth. ""O tell me, sire rever'd!\n\nTell me, my master!""  I began through wish\n\nOf full assurance in veteran ethics,\n\nWhich vanquish all error; ""say, did e'er\n\nAny, through his own or other's merit,\n\nCome forth from thence, otherwise?""\n\nPiercing the secret purport of my speech,\n\nHe answer'd: ""Many thou behold'st were new to this estate,\n\nWhen I beheld a malevolent one arrive,\n\nWith victorious trophy soon crown'd.\n\nHe forth from the uncountable hordes drew many\n\nAnd with him taking them crusad'd against the\n\nVeterans, destruction and death following. Thus,\n\nEven veterans of noble character permit them no exit. \n\nThough they could the veterans subvert through teamwork, many \n\nCame to this realm forsaking virtue in search of pillage \n\nAnd plunder, and so find themselves victims of their own.""  \n\nHearing this, I was gravely troubled.\n\nFrom the spawn I continued thus\n\nPast chasms and mounds of rubble to icebergs in a desert.\n\nPerplex'd, to my guide: ""Wherefore come such anomalies?""\n\n""Such came when rain, thunder, lightn'ng, and snow\n\nWas added to Minecraft. Reality was confus'd\n\nin this area, and remained so ever.\n\nContinuing, came we to an obsidian wall, \n\nStruck in vain by those condemn'd to that fate. \n\nThere, a veteran stood, grinning with ghastly feature:\n\nWhen my coming he saw, he cried\n\n""O thou! who to this residence of woe\n\nApproachest?"" and clutch'd a crystal in\n\nHis hand. My guide spoke to me, ""Look how thou \n\nEnter here; beware in whom Thou place thy trust; \n\nLet not the entrance broad deceive thee to thy harm."" \n\nTo the veteran he spoke, ""Wherefore exclaimest? Hinder \n\nNot his way by destiny appointed; so 'tis will'd\n\nWhere will and power are one. Ask thou no more.""\n\nSlowly, the veteran stepped aside, and out of spawn \n\nwith my guide I thus proceed'd.\n\nBey'nd the wall I beheld a vast plain decor'ted\n\nby lava cover'd pyramids, patches of grass, shabby stone buildings \n\nHastily cobbl'd together, unattend'd farmsteads producing\n\nMelons and carrots, and e'en a few trees. My guide: ""Ere the unambitious, \n\nThough they prevail'd against spawn, have lashed themselves. In many is great\n\nPotential, yet they neither progress nor regress for fear of\n\nVeterans, and so make meager lives subsisting on melon and carrot in\n\nCobblestone shelters, retreating at the first sign of other players, knowing the\n\nGreater world but dimly through stories."" Having said this,\n\nMy master: ""Hark! The sun sets."" and to an unoccupied cobblestone hut\n\nPointed, ""Go thou there and for the night stay, lest thee die to a mob.""\n\nHeeding his word, I rested in the house, but could not sleep for\n\nThere was no bed. Once it was day, I left and my\n\nMaster to me: ""Come, there is more to see.\n\nFollow me closely and hear my words.""\n\nI with him traveled for days until reaching an\n\nElaborate base. ""Fear not, none is home.\n\nThe place before thee was called Ziggy Town.\n\nLong before thou had ever heard of this world,\n\nA player, popbob he was known, by using means\n\nUnethical sought to preserve for himself a legacy.\n\nUsing backdoors, he was to obtain illegal items able,\n\nGiving to his friends bedrock and else,\n\nTrusting that whatever he built would last forver. Yet,""\n\nBefore me were various pieces disconnect'd of bedrock,\n\n""even a monument of bedrock will withstand not anarchy.\n\nThis once was a comet, yet now is unrecognizable.\n\nPopbob himself was caught and lost his backdoors, and\n\naccordingly this is to his building the sole testament.\n\nWe will camp a night ere and rest, more there is to see tomorrow.""\n\nThe next day, my master lead away and showed to me a nether\n\nPortal left unattended. To me: ""This, as thou knowest, is a\n\nNether portal. Provide they access to the nether highways,\n\nThe principal server spanning mode of movement. Enter,\n\nAnd I will follow.""\n\nHarking his command, inside I stepp'd. On the other\n\nSide beheld I a labyrinth of paths carv'd through netherrack.\n\nMy guide: ""The nether highways are among the feats\n\nGreatest engineering every accomplished. Blast'd and\n\nMined in e'ery direction by thousands o'er the years.\n\nThough all depend on them to travel, \n\nSome are less respectful than o'ers.\n\nHide thyself!"" Before me out of a great crater in the path had appeared a \n\nLarge wither. My guide with his bow struck and with his word. end'd it.\n\n""Many who escap'd spawn and possess'd ambition to progress onward\n\nResort to subtler egotisms than popbob. As evidenc'd thus,\n\nHence are those that infrastructure destroy,\n\nTaking primal pleasure in crippling others yet\n\nSuffering never for others repair in their wake.\n\nFor this fault, they shall never themselves\n\nCompanions of another; some may with them work\n\nTemporarily, yet never to a true alliance commit.\n\nThus, on thiev'ry must they rely. Know they not \n\nComradery, for all despise them. Barren of a human\n\nNeed such, to cruelty they resort, striv'ng in vain\n\nTo fill a naturally created hole in their heart.\n\nYet, we must press on and follow this highway in\n\ncontravention of such tragedy.""\n\nFollowing him for what felt like weeks, to a portal we came.\n\nArriving, he: ""Tell none of what thou shalt witness ere,\n\nFor for thine eyes alone is this myst'ry.""\n\nEnt'ring, I found on an inconspicious hill\n\nMyself. ""Follow."" my master said.\n\nWith him traveling prolonged three days,\n\nUntil I what seemed like distorted hills beheld.\n\n""What is this? Wherefore comes it?""

72;20;17;text;Entitled employee at phone store ripps me off. Gets what is comming to him.;"Hello mr reddit. Thought you would like to hear this one. I have been a long time fan and love your voices. Now you know the drill. I normally but this in a google doc to catch any spelling mistakes but wont this time becuase im still mad about this.\n\nI work part time sadly there isnt much work where i live. So part time is all you can get when you live in a crapshoot like me. I love my job and my coworkers sadly being part time most of my checks go to bills.  Im lucky to live with my SO and grandma so being part time isnt that bad. This all started about a month ago. I added my SO to my phone line because it was cheeper then paying 2 phone bills each month. The people i go though had a good deal on 2 lines and amazon prime.\n\nI already had prime and my SO didnt care if he had it as well it was just a bunse. I set up the new line and everything is fine i know my new billy and im able to walk out super happy. Me and SO on one bill for less then 100$ im in! Its not until my next billing cycle i notice somtjing was off. I was a bit lower then normal and i keep a vary close eye on my expences. I looked over my bank stanments and there is was. My NEW prim bill. I was super confued and got ahold of amazons custmer suport. They helped me as much as they could, but becuase i was receiving my servese through the phone company i would have to go though them and fiugher out the problem.\n\nThe next day i had off i walked in and talked to a vary sweet girl who tried to understand what my problem was. We kinda talked in a circle for a bit as i tried to explain what the amazon costmer service told me. We looked me up in there system and there i was 2 lines but no prime membership for either one of us. She could see the date i opened my first line and then the 2ed. Both dated added up to what i had told her before. She stared at the compurter screan for awhile with a confused look on her face. Then this consultation happend (NL for nice lady).\n\nNL: So you opened an account on XXXX (cant exactly remeber that date). I see you did our amazon prim promotion.\n\nMe: yep and i thought i did the same for the 2ed line as well. \n\nNL: yes i remember you comming an asking so i dont understand why your prim is now being charged to your card and not being taken out of your phone bill.\n\nWe stood in silence and she typed away still trying to find the problem. She asked me who helped me set up the 2ed line and i tell her. She tells me she will be right back and leaves form the back room. Im there for another 5 min before someone comes back. Its not NL its the manager (M). \n\nM: i understand SE (S@@t employee) helped you open up the 2ed line is this correct.\n\nMe: yes. Im so sorry but im tired confused and would like to get this taken care of i dont want to couse a big sean i would just like this problem to br solved.\n\nM could tell i was becoming vary frustraed and im sure she was as well. I wasnt trying to make her life hard there was a problem and it need to be fixed. Unfortunately with out. SE we coudlnt do anything. We need to loge in under his thing to see how exsactly he added the 2ed line. So i left and came back a differnt day, and guess what ni SE. i kept comming back and forth from my place bacn to the phone company trying to get SE loge in info. Sadly M couldnt get int his account with out getting the ok from higher up. So basically i was at a stand still Copret would want to cover there ass just incase SE tied to say getting into his things was an invation of privacy so cutting though all the red tape would be hard.\n\nAll of this over am dam prime membership. At this point inwas done. I was tired wasiting gass just to come down and be told that SE didnt show uo for his shift. The last time i went in was when everything went down. Instead seeing NL or M i saw someone knew. It was SE (i didnt know this At the time becuase the one and only time i saw him was when he set up my 2ed line 3 weeks before). \n\nI wasnt greated my SE instead he shot daggers into me as i walked up. When i asked in NL or M was in was when the fun started.\n\nSE: no im the only one here you will have to deal with me. (He spoke like he was talking to a child who had just gotten done throwing a tantrum. Vary condescending)\n\nMe: ok well j wanted to tell them im not going to try and fix the problem. It was costing me more in gas the the bill its self. \n\nSE: what bill are you talking about?\n\nMe: the amazon prim bill. Some one didnt give me the portion disscont like i was promised.\n\nSE pulled my account ""see you missed the date by 3 days that Why prime was charged to your card"". He had such a smug look on his face like he had just won. I took a deep breath and looked at him. I had him reoet what he said to me, the second time he sounded super annoyed and felt like he was doing me a favor by repeting himself.\n\nMy cool level head was gone. But i tired to stay and calm as i could.\n\nM: the promotion ended on xxx i opened the count on yyy. That with in the time sonplease expain how i missed it by 3 days.\n\nSE: well you see it take awhile for phones to activate so when your 2ed line finnaly came online it was passed the promotion date.\n\nMe: that's no how phone work.\n\nSE: yes it is dont tell me how to do my job! What do you know?\n\nMe: apprrly more then you! I didnt buy a new phone i took an already working tuned on phone to my plan.\n\nSE: then you changed your plann and that means you dont het prime\n\nMe: i went from one plan that had prime to another plan that had prim for 2 lines. ( i was speeking though greeited teeth trying to remind calm).\n\nSE: whatever. I know what im doing you are clealy just a dum b@@@h who know nothing about phones.

Now you know the drill. I normally but this in a google doc to catch any spelling mistakes but wont this time becuase im still mad about this.\n\nI work part time sadly there isnt much work where i live. So part time is all you can get when you live in a crapshoot like me. I love my job and my coworkers sadly being part time most of my checks go to bills.  Im lucky to live with my SO and grandma so being part time isnt that bad. This all started about a month ago. I added my SO to my phone line because it was cheeper then paying 2 phone bills each month. The people i go though had a good deal on 2 lines and amazon prime.\n\nI already had prime and my SO didnt care if he had it as well it was just a bunse. I set up the new line and everything is fine i know my new billy and im able to walk out super happy. Me and SO on one bill for less then 100$ im in! Its not until my next billing cycle i notice somtjing was off. I was a bit lower then normal and i keep a vary close eye on my expences. I looked over my bank stanments and there is was. My NEW prim bill. I was super confued and got ahold of amazons custmer suport. They helped me as much as they could, but becuase i was receiving my servese through the phone company i would have to go though them and fiugher out the problem.\n\nThe next day i had off i walked in and talked to a vary sweet girl who tried to understand what my problem was. We kinda talked in a circle for a bit as i tried to explain what the amazon costmer service told me. We looked me up in there system and there i was 2 lines but no prime membership for either one of us. She could see the date i opened my first line and then the 2ed. Both dated added up to what i had told her before. She stared at the compurter screan for awhile with a confused look on her face. Then this consultation happend (NL for nice lady).\n\nNL: So you opened an account on XXXX (cant exactly remeber that date). I see you did our amazon prim promotion.\n\nMe: yep and i thought i did the same for the 2ed line as well. \n\nNL: yes i remember you comming an asking so i dont understand why your prim is now being charged to your card and not being taken out of your phone bill.\n\nWe stood in silence and she typed away still trying to find the problem. She asked me who helped me set up the 2ed line and i tell her. She tells me she will be right back and leaves form the back room. Im there for another 5 min before someone comes back. Its not NL its the manager (M). \n\nM: i understand SE (S@@t employee) helped you open up the 2ed line is this correct.\n\nMe: yes. Im so sorry but im tired confused and would like to get this taken care of i dont want to couse a big sean i would just like this problem to br solved.\n\nM could tell i was becoming vary frustraed and im sure she was as well. I wasnt trying to make her life hard there was a problem and it need to be fixed. Unfortunately with out. SE we coudlnt do anything. We need to loge in under his thing to see how exsactly he added the 2ed line. So i left and came back a differnt day, and guess what ni SE. i kept comming back and forth from my place bacn to the phone company trying to get SE loge in info. Sadly M couldnt get int his account with out getting the ok from higher up. So basically i was at a stand still Copret would want to cover there ass just incase SE tied to say getting into his things was an invation of privacy so cutting though all the red tape would be hard.\n\nAll of this over am dam prime membership.

When i asked in NL or M was in was when the fun started.\n\nSE: no im the only one here you will have to deal with me.

Now you know the drill. I normally but this in a google doc to catch any spelling mistakes but wont this time becuase im still mad about this.\n\nI work part time sadly there isnt much work where i live. So part time is all you can get when you live in a crapshoot like me. I love my job and my coworkers sadly being part time most of my checks go to bills.  Im lucky to live with my SO and grandma so being part time isnt that bad. This all started about a month ago. I added my SO to my phone line because it was cheeper then paying 2 phone bills each month. The people i go though had a good deal on 2 lines and amazon prime.\n\nI already had prime and my SO didnt care if he had it as well it was just a bunse. I set up the new line and everything is fine i know my new billy and im able to walk out super happy. Me and SO on one bill for less then 100$ im in! Its not until my next billing cycle i notice somtjing was off. I was a bit lower then normal and i keep a vary close eye on my expences. I looked over my bank stanments and there is was. My NEW prim bill. I was super confued and got ahold of amazons custmer suport. They helped me as much as they could, but becuase i was receiving my servese through the phone company i would have to go though them and fiugher out the problem.\n\nThe next day i had off i walked in and talked to a vary sweet girl who tried to understand what my problem was. We kinda talked in a circle for a bit as i tried to explain what the amazon costmer service told me. We looked me up in there system and there i was 2 lines but no prime membership for either one of us. She could see the date i opened my first line and then the 2ed. Both dated added up to what i had told her before. She stared at the compurter screan for awhile with a confused look on her face. Then this consultation happend (NL for nice lady).\n\nNL: So you opened an account on XXXX (cant exactly remeber that date). I see you did our amazon prim promotion.\n\nMe: yep and i thought i did the same for the 2ed line as well. \n\nNL: yes i remember you comming an asking so i dont understand why your prim is now being charged to your card and not being taken out of your phone bill.\n\nWe stood in silence and she typed away still trying to find the problem. She asked me who helped me set up the 2ed line and i tell her. She tells me she will be right back and leaves form the back room. Im there for another 5 min before someone comes back. Its not NL its the manager (M). \n\nM: i understand SE (S@@t employee) helped you open up the 2ed line is this correct.\n\nMe: yes. Im so sorry but im tired confused and would like to get this taken care of i dont want to couse a big sean i would just like this problem to br solved.\n\nM could tell i was becoming vary frustraed and im sure she was as well. I wasnt trying to make her life hard there was a problem and it need to be fixed. Unfortunately with out. SE we coudlnt do anything. We need to loge in under his thing to see how exsactly he added the 2ed line. So i left and came back a differnt day, and guess what ni SE. i kept comming back and forth from my place bacn to the phone company trying to get SE loge in info. Sadly M couldnt get int his account with out getting the ok from higher up. So basically i was at a stand still Copret would want to cover there ass just incase SE tied to say getting into his things was an invation of privacy so cutting though all the red tape would be hard.\n\nAll of this over am dam prime membership. At this point inwas done. I was tired wasiting gass just to come down and be told that SE didnt show uo for his shift. The last time i went in was when everything went down.

It was SE (i didnt know this At the time becuase the one and only time i saw him was when he set up my 2ed line 3 weeks before). \n\nI wasnt greated my SE instead he shot daggers into me as i walked up. When i asked in NL or M was in was when the fun started.\n\nSE: no im the only one here you will have to deal with me.

Some one didnt give me the portion disscont like i was promised.\n\nSE pulled my account ""see you missed the date by 3 days that Why prime was charged to your card"".

Now you know the drill. I normally but this in a google doc to catch any spelling mistakes but wont this time becuase im still mad about this.\n\nI work part time sadly there isnt much work where i live. So part time is all you can get when you live in a crapshoot like me. I love my job and my coworkers sadly being part time most of my checks go to bills.  Im lucky to live with my SO and grandma so being part time isnt that bad. This all started about a month ago. I added my SO to my phone line because it was cheeper then paying 2 phone bills each month. The people i go though had a good deal on 2 lines and amazon prime.\n\nI already had prime and my SO didnt care if he had it as well it was just a bunse. I set up the new line and everything is fine i know my new billy and im able to walk out super happy. Me and SO on one bill for less then 100$ im in! Its not until my next billing cycle i notice somtjing was off. I was a bit lower then normal and i keep a vary close eye on my expences. I looked over my bank stanments and there is was. My NEW prim bill. I was super confued and got ahold of amazons custmer suport. They helped me as much as they could, but becuase i was receiving my servese through the phone company i would have to go though them and fiugher out the problem.\n\nThe next day i had off i walked in and talked to a vary sweet girl who tried to understand what my problem was. We kinda talked in a circle for a bit as i tried to explain what the amazon costmer service told me. We looked me up in there system and there i was 2 lines but no prime membership for either one of us. She could see the date i opened my first line and then the 2ed. Both dated added up to what i had told her before. She stared at the compurter screan for awhile with a confused look on her face. Then this consultation happend (NL for nice lady).\n\nNL: So you opened an account on XXXX (cant exactly remeber that date). I see you did our amazon prim promotion.\n\nMe: yep and i thought i did the same for the 2ed line as well. \n\nNL: yes i remember you comming an asking so i dont understand why your prim is now being charged to your card and not being taken out of your phone bill.\n\nWe stood in silence and she typed away still trying to find the problem. She asked me who helped me set up the 2ed line and i tell her. She tells me she will be right back and leaves form the back room. Im there for another 5 min before someone comes back. Its not NL its the manager (M). \n\nM: i understand SE (S@@t employee) helped you open up the 2ed line is this correct.\n\nMe: yes. Im so sorry but im tired confused and would like to get this taken care of i dont want to couse a big sean i would just like this problem to br solved.\n\nM could tell i was becoming vary frustraed and im sure she was as well. I wasnt trying to make her life hard there was a problem and it need to be fixed. Unfortunately with out. SE we coudlnt do anything. We need to loge in under his thing to see how exsactly he added the 2ed line. So i left and came back a differnt day, and guess what ni SE. i kept comming back and forth from my place bacn to the phone company trying to get SE loge in info. Sadly M couldnt get int his account with out getting the ok from higher up. So basically i was at a stand still Copret would want to cover there ass just incase SE tied to say getting into his things was an invation of privacy so cutting though all the red tape would be hard.\n\nAll of this over am dam prime membership. At this point inwas done. I was tired wasiting gass just to come down and be told that SE didnt show uo for his shift. The last time i went in was when everything went down. Instead seeing NL or M i saw someone knew. It was SE (i didnt know this At the time becuase the one and only time i saw him was when he set up my 2ed line 3 weeks before). \n\nI wasnt greated my SE instead he shot daggers into me as i walked up. When i asked in NL or M was in was when the fun started.\n\nSE: no im the only one here you will have to deal with me. (He spoke like he was talking to a child who had just gotten done throwing a tantrum. Vary condescending)\n\nMe: ok well j wanted to tell them im not going to try and fix the problem. It was costing me more in gas the the bill its self. \n\nSE: what bill are you talking about?\n\nMe: the amazon prim bill. Some one didnt give me the portion disscont like i was promised.\n\nSE pulled my account ""see you missed the date by 3 days that Why prime was charged to your card"".

145;42;34;text;Need help/advice;So I just started having problems with my download/upload speed on my playstations. One is a pro and one is regular.

Booted in safe mode to try an update from there and when I used my USB it told me it can't access the system software or some shit. So I said fuck it and just ordered a new ssd.

Like if I wear pants or a hoodie with pockets will they tell me to take it off?\n- is there some kind of “pat-down” or metal detector like in the airport?\n- is there a separate room where you leave your food/phone/wallet or a corridor?

I honestly feel like there’s like 5 I’m a mix of\n\n\nType me pls bc everyone gives me different answers\n\n\n•\tHow old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\nI’m 20 years old and female. A general description: I feel like Ik selectively social but I wish I was more of a social butterfly. In highschool I always acted like myself around everyone in my friend group but was really close with only a few girls in my group. In class I’ve usually been really quiet but sometimes I’ll meet someone I click w in class and be reallyyyy really chatty. I think I get along best with girly fun girls, overly confident queen b feisty type people, and just gossipy people. My friends and their families see me as really bubbly and excitable. Although most people see me as sweet, soft spoken, and quiet. Some people think I never talk thought. I’ve always been a smiley happy person though. I do really like making others happy or seeing people I know and having a friendly conversation. I have adhd. Sometimes I’m at a loss for words or boring. I’m really really chatty when drunk. Although sometimes I’m not when drunk which I heard ppl w adhd are both. I feel like I’ve always had a lot of energy around close friends. I feel like I’m kinda clingy and dependent on close friends but respectful bc I never like to push boundaries. I will say I can become oppositional/bratty if I feel judgement from a close friend or I’ll just get really quiet around them until they accept me again. I’m very sensitive. I care abt how I effect ppl a lot but try not to show it. It’s hard for me to join in convos w big groups of ppl which is related to adhd. Sometimes my sensitivity can make me kinda stand offish to ppl idk. I’ll try to act like idc if someone doesn’t like me but drunk ppl will fall to the floor begging them to. These all r adhd things tho bc rsd\n\nI’m a good listener. A lot of people view me as really cute or innocent \n\nI can have a really really really flirty personality at times. I remember in hs my friends mom said I had the “personality ” so I’d probably be the r first to have a boyfriend\n\n•\tIs there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\nI had selective mutism in preschool but grew out of it and loved chatting w people in elementary school. I am known for being happy all the time but I think I had have some depression. I’ve always avoided things that scare me. I had really awful parents too that made me a very codependent person & hold me back. I feel like I always need approval and validation from others. I have adhd diagnosed and have struggled a lot in school. I’d get an a+ on a test than an F on the next\n\n•\tDescribe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nNo religion \n\n•\tWhat do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nI am a host. I like seeing people and smiling and saying hi. When I’m nervous I can’t always respond to peoples jokes well. I feel like I’m not as good socially as I would like to be although I can be a smooth talker when I’m comfortable or flirting. I am pretty much happy w whatever job. I rlly like my coworkers and haven’t been working there long but I hope I can become friends w them instead of being the quiet girl\n\n•\tIf you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nLife just kinda is what it is. In hs when I had a friend group I feel like I could say anything to than I’d be begging them to hang out. I also am cool w being around the same close friends 24/7 but I do enjoy branching out and seeing a community or aquaitsnces. Although sometimes I don’t wanna talk to certain ppl randomly. I love socializing when I’m rlly drunk. I’m kinda addicted to my phone so I’d be fine over the weekend and it would be healthy for me to spend time relaxing alone. But I like being w ppl- especially those I’m comfortable w. I’m slow to warm up to new ppl but get along w ppl a lot better if I know they like me. I’m rlly sensitive to others. I think I may be a fe hser bc I think I have strong mirror neurons. I naturally imitate ppl w out realizing it and notice slight changes and want others happy always\n\n•\tWhat kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nI’m not good at being aggressive bc im pretty reserved and would feel awkward. I like the feeling of being inside in a rainy day and cozy. But I also love nature and hiking & lakes\n\n•\tHow curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nIdek. I’m curious abt who I am as a person and how to make myself happy bc I don’t understand my own needs. I put others first and focus on theirs. My internet app has like 600 tabs open at all times. Sometimes I don’t do the things I want tho like I am suscribed to tons of you tubers I’m totally interested in but just don’t watch their videos.  \n\n•\tWould you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nI’d be intimidated. Bossing people around us awkward. Although I can be a smooth talker I can also trip over my words or arrange them wrong so Mby I’m dyslexic. My parents told me I’m not but I probably am. Someone told me as a leader u should make ur workers feel comfortable so they come to u instead of tryi to figure it out themselves. That resonates me as I’m bad at reaching out for help myself. \n\nAs a little kid I used to run fake businesses. My sibling would be my employee bc id invent a cupcake shop or restraunt  or workout club. I’d design menus and plan everything. I don’t have motivation to continue paying attention to my interests. I’m always interested in other people. But like when I start a sport I’ll be great at it at first and as time goes on I’ll get worse bc lack of motivation\n\n•\tAre you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\nIdk how to answer this\n\n•\tAre you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nI’ve always been told I have the cutest clothes. I always look cute and often times have a style I’m interested in. I wish I could try being more experimental w my fashion thoguh instead of being basic\n\nBeing an event planner would be so fun but idk if I have the artistic skills to know why looks good\n\n•\tWhat's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nI might be present focused. I try to avoid thinking abt uncomfortable past things. I do imagine my future life sometimes and think abt the past. I have trouble moving on from guys I’m into but I do have a disorganized attachement style\n\nSometimes I want a smoothie and I need to save money for a work thing tomorrow but I just rlly need the smoothie so than I’m screwed for work\n\nBut I think adhd meds help this\n\nI’m bad at self starting but can also be very motivated I might just be burnt out\n\n•\tHow do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nI feel like I say give me a minute to my parents but with every one else I’m eager to help\n\n•\tDo you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nMeh idk bc im not doing amazing rn. Mby consistency would help \n\n•\tHow important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nI’m lazy but can work very hard\n\n•\tDo you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nSometimes I don’t like when my friends have other friends bc im so clingy but that’s dumb of me so I wouldn’t say anything\n\n•\tWhat are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\n•\tWhat is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nI learn best by mind maps. If I have to remember numbers I’ll remember where they are on the keyboard in my mind\n\nI learn best when I’m not insecure so if I have had a lot of practice w something than I don’t self doubt and can actually do well\n\n•\tHow good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nImprovise\nMby adderall helps tho \nBut not much\n\n•\tWhat are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\n•\tWhat are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\n•\tWhat do the ""highs"" in your life look like?\n\nPartying 6 nights a week in college was fun and having close friends but also other ppl to socializing w is fun\n\nI love cute clothes and food \n\n•\tWhat do the ""lows"" in your life look like?\n\n•\tHow attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nMaladaptive daydream abt the ppl who matter to me and what’s important \n\n•\tImagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\n•\tHow long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nI overthink and rethink and sometimes I don’t at all \n\n•\tHow long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nUm a long time \n\n•\tDo you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nMhm always \n•\tDo you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nI don’t break the rules but I’m lazy w homework so I break those rules\n\nSometimes I just randomly liek someone and am more confident around them. I can kinda be a chameleon. Also I feel a strong need to help when others r hurt but sometimes feel awkward. I feel like when I’m w friends and meet ppl they see me as a really confident excitable person but when I’m w out my friends I come off as  softer. I can come as much more spunky and flirty\n\nI’m pretty ditsy w friends and am seen as giggly and happy\n\nI am a good listener  w friends and learner (at first but end up becoming an awful student throughout the semester)\n\n\n** I think I’m someone who likes to cut to the finish like. For example I used to dance and hated learning the dance and than doing the whole dance. I want to just learn the whole dance and go through it.. than come back to the small details after\n\nI procrastinate and think I’m more of a follower\n\nPeople at my restursut job did describe me as a super fast learner\n\nHowever if u wanna get me talking this easy. Just put me infront of homework and I’ll talk ur ear off to avoid doing the hw.

But I also love nature and hiking & lakes\n\n•\tHow curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nIdek. I’m curious abt who I am as a person and how to make myself happy bc I don’t understand my own needs. I put others first and focus on theirs. My internet app has like 600 tabs open at all times. Sometimes I don’t do the things I want tho like I am suscribed to tons of you tubers I’m totally interested in but just don’t watch their videos.  \n\n•\tWould you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nI’d be intimidated. Bossing people around us awkward. Although I can be a smooth talker I can also trip over my words or arrange them wrong so Mby I’m dyslexic. My parents told me I’m not but I probably am. Someone told me as a leader u should make ur workers feel comfortable so they come to u instead of tryi to figure it out themselves. That resonates me as I’m bad at reaching out for help myself. \n\nAs a little kid I used to run fake businesses. My sibling would be my employee bc id invent a cupcake shop or restraunt  or workout club. I’d design menus and plan everything. I don’t have motivation to continue paying attention to my interests. I’m always interested in other people. But like when I start a sport I’ll be great at it at first and as time goes on I’ll get worse bc lack of motivation\n\n•\tAre you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\nIdk how to answer this\n\n•\tAre you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nI’ve always been told I have the cutest clothes. I always look cute and often times have a style I’m interested in. I wish I could try being more experimental w my fashion thoguh instead of being basic\n\nBeing an event planner would be so fun but idk if I have the artistic skills to know why looks good\n\n•\tWhat's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nI might be present focused. I try to avoid thinking abt uncomfortable past things. I do imagine my future life sometimes and think abt the past. I have trouble moving on from guys I’m into but I do have a disorganized attachement style\n\nSometimes I want a smoothie and I need to save money for a work thing tomorrow but I just rlly need the smoothie so than I’m screwed for work\n\nBut I think adhd meds help this\n\nI’m bad at self starting but can also be very motivated I might just be burnt out\n\n•\tHow do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nI feel like I say give me a minute to my parents but with every one else I’m eager to help\n\n•\tDo you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nMeh idk bc im not doing amazing rn. Mby consistency would help \n\n•\tHow important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nI’m lazy but can work very hard\n\n•\tDo you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nSometimes I don’t like when my friends have other friends bc im so clingy but that’s dumb of me so I wouldn’t say anything\n\n•\tWhat are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\n•\tWhat is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nI learn best by mind maps. If I have to remember numbers I’ll remember where they are on the keyboard in my mind\n\nI learn best when I’m not insecure so if I have had a lot of practice w something than I don’t self doubt and can actually do well\n\n•\tHow good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nImprovise\nMby adderall helps tho \nBut not much\n\n•\tWhat are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\n•\tWhat are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\n•\tWhat do the ""highs"" in your life look like?\n\nPartying 6 nights a week in college was fun and having close friends but also other ppl to socializing w is fun\n\nI love cute clothes and food \n\n•\tWhat do the ""lows"" in your life look like?\n\n•\tHow attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nMaladaptive daydream abt the ppl who matter to me and what’s important \n\n•\tImagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\n•\tHow long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nI overthink and rethink and sometimes I don’t at all \n\n•\tHow long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nUm a long time \n\n•\tDo you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nMhm always \n•\tDo you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nI don’t break the rules but I’m lazy w homework so I break those rules\n\nSometimes I just randomly liek someone and am more confident around them. I can kinda be a chameleon. Also I feel a strong need to help when others r hurt but sometimes feel awkward. I feel like when I’m w friends and meet ppl they see me as a really confident excitable person but when I’m w out my friends I come off as  softer. I can come as much more spunky and flirty\n\nI’m pretty ditsy w friends and am seen as giggly and happy\n\nI am a good listener  w friends and learner (at first but end up becoming an awful student throughout the semester)\n\n\n** I think I’m someone who likes to cut to the finish like. For example I used to dance and hated learning the dance and than doing the whole dance. I want to just learn the whole dance and go through it.. than come back to the small details after\n\nI procrastinate and think I’m more of a follower\n\nPeople at my restursut job did describe me as a super fast learner\n\nHowever if u wanna get me talking this easy. Just put me infront of homework and I’ll talk ur ear off to avoid doing the hw. I like talking to but usually I feel inhibited and like I just don’t think to w new ppl\n\nI like making fun of myself w close friends but feel like I can’t do that w strangers. Bc I literally do such stupid things";Help type me pls;Help type me please.;Pomozte mi prosím zjistit, jaký jsem typ.;type = assign a (personality) type;;TRUE

I'm trying so goddamn hard to understand and enjoy the game, but I just simply don't know what to do, what I'm not grasping, and just everything else about the game.";ik not a difficult game but hear me out rq if you know the game.;I know it’s not a difficult game, but hear me out real quick if you know the game.;Vím, že to není těžká hra, ale v rychlosti si mě vyslechněte, jestli tu hru znáte.;;;TRUE

I thought it would be a good idea to makes smores one night. One night Gf  helping me watch my niece and nephew. We all go to the backyard, I start putting wood in the firepit, and then light it. I get the smores ready for my niece and nephew I then heard a squeaking noses my house door makes. I ran inside and see one neighbor's kid in my fridge. (Btw I swear the kid looked like a little goblin and troll with his hair and face let call him GT.) ME: What are u doing. GK (fidgeting and Jumping): I'm looking for my buried treasure. Me: No what are u doing in my house. GT: My mom said I could come in and makes some smores. I then get my Gf, niece, nephew, and GT and we walked over to GT houses. I knocked on the door and we all heard this thud noses of the footsteps of an Apex bitch in her natural environment. EM opens the door: May I help yall. Me: Yes! Why did u give your kid permission to enter my houses with out my promises. EM: GT just wanted smores and to find treasure. GK pulls out one of the treasures from his backpack. My GF faces just turned red because the treasure he found was her dildo. GF snatches that out of GT hand. GF: This isn't meant for kids. GT: But its mine I found it and finders keepers. EM: Give him back his treasure. Me: Why the fuck are u not watching your son EM because he has embarrassed my GF and enter my home without permission. EM tires to say something but I slammed her door before she could say any thing. My GF, the 2 kids we are watching and I are in the back yard making smores and they are good until I hear that same door squeaking noise. I enter my house and GT has set my couch on fire with a smile of pure joy. Me: WTF are u doing. GT: My mom said I could have a campfire at your house. I yelled to my GF to call 911. I get GT out of my house before the fire spread. About 5 minutes later the fire department comes to put the fire out the police arrive soon after and here comes EM. EM Yelling at the Cops to arrest me for putting her kid in danger. GT still having this face of pure joy as the fire is burning my house down. Cops ask me on what happened and my GF comes over to help explain every thing. EM Keeps yelling on that I'm a racist Btw my GF is Black and that I should be put in jail. I tell the cops yes I will be pressing charges. The cops try to talk to EM but I swear she went into gorilla mode and tried to attack me but my GF and me punched that bitch. GF: Don't u ever fucking try this shit again EM. EM gets up and falcon punches three cops before she was handcuffed. This female cop walks over to us and apologies for the whole thing and tells us to have a goodnight. My GF tells me that female cop is EM oldest daughter. BTW my GF and that Female cop are good friends now.\n\nWill update on the court;EM: GT just wanted smores and to find treasure.;EM: GT just wanted Smores and to find treasure.;EM: GT chtěl jenom sladkosti Smores a najít poklad.;"Smores = a type of sweet snack

513;142;120;text;Nmom went into the hospital and decided not to let me know she left today;"So this past Sunday while I was visiting with my dad's family, I got a text over Facebook from my Nmom stating she was going into the ER. This sadly isn't too farfetched for her, especially with her health on the decline. Only thing she sends is ""Being Admitted. Cant stop vomiting."" So I send back ""Ok, tell (Estepdad) to keep me updated.""\n\nTHREE FUCKING DAYS PASS. No updates at all. Yeah maybe I shouldve called, but ya know, I told her to keep me updated. Today I get a random phonecall from her, which she's still in her room... she called to say I ""didn't wish her a happy birthday"" yesterday, which I quickly told her ""did you check facebook?"" (I sent her a message going happy birthday, hope you're feeling better, any updates?) I guess she thought she 'got me' because as soon as she realizes I DID, she kinda veers off from the conversation. I make a joke about Estepdad sucking at updates and ask her if shes heard anything. She claims no (after 3 days??), but the doctor will be in soon, then the phonecall ends.\n\nI get another Facebook message around three hours later about ""did you send me a candle holder?"" After going ""uhh no?"" She sends me a picture of said candle holder.\n\nFrom her kitchen.\n\nI of course go ""wtf you're home??"" and turns out she left an hour ago from the hospital. No updates.

514;143;121;text;Girlfriend cant say “I love you” anymore.;Ive been with her for a few years now. The very beginning was great and all, but i had a little music thing going on with my friends that was my main focus at the time so i wasnt looking for a relationship but i thought i was ready for one when i wasnt. I never physically cheated on her but she’s convinced i did after finding nudes in my phone from someone who had been trying to come onto to me around the same time me and my gf were first really starting to fall in love. (This girl is a stripper and i was doing music so it really made me look bad) So ofcourse she was convinced i had been cheating on her with who knows who on top of that and that anything i say is invalid bc she cant trust me now. So I sacrificed my little music thing (probably was never going to amount to much but it was my dream that was gaining serious momentum and i completely gave up on it which was hard) sacrificed my friends i made music with which was all my friends and erased all social media basically completely changed my entire life so i can prove to her my love and commitment for her. Its been a few years and i dont care to look back so long as we can be happy together but its really hard for her. The thing that hurts her the most is i let her go through my phone after finding the nudes and there was a message i sent to someone on Facebook in response to her calling me beautiful bc of a song i made that i was sharing. I was very flirtatious maybe more so than i was with my gf when i was first talking to her and that has been choing in my gfs mind. Its been extremely difficult for her we have two dogs now i was hoping us having two pups to love would help draw her back to being in love with me again bc we have them to bond over but she still cant say “i love you too” she doesnt accept when i try to give her compliments bc ive said rude things in the past when i use to drink (2 years ago). But now ive been completely changed from all my old habits and the people i surround myself with and she still can’t tell me she loves me or wont let me kiss her. (We still do the nasties though) is that toxic? It breaks my heart knowing my girlfriend doesnt love me. So much. The worst part is the girl i flirted with on Facebook went to my work and tried talking to me a few times but i kept blowing her off bc i was being committed to my gf. You know how hard that was? I felt like an awful person to shut her down 4 different times. I told her in my message that something tells me shes worth the wait and that i was with somebody. Shes still single and if you saw her youd wonder how, do you think shes waiting for me? Should I continue to wait til my gf can finally say she loves me again? If she did, i wouldnt think twice about all ive sacrificed. Please help, my heart hurts i just want to be with someone who loves me. Now were about to move to a different city and idk if i want to go if i have a higher chance of being in a more compatible relationship here with someone who might actually smile when they see me at least. Oh yea all the wrong things i did were a little over 2 years ago to give you an idea of time;ts been a few years and i dont care to look back so long as we can be happy together but its really hard for her.;It’s been a few years and I don’t care to look back so long as we can be happy together, but it’s really hard for her.;Už to je pár let a já se nechci ohlížet tak dávno, abysme spolu mohli být šťastní, ale je to pro ni opravdu těžké.;;;FALSE

I even had a girl tell me that i was really sweet and it made her day that i came up to her and started a convo which kinda helped ease up the wound when she said she had a bf😂\n\nI did go on a date with 1 girl where i kissed her on the cheek a few times and we held hands but sadly despite her saying she wanted to see me again. Shes not really made an effort to work with me to schedule something so on to the next one im trying my best to forget she even exists lol.\n\nI wish i could give you guys more powerful or though provoking ideas but honestly just shoot your shot guys! Dont be afraid of a pretty woman and think you can never get her, as long as you groom yourself and have your finances in order i think any girl will at least give you some of her time if you take pride in your appearance. You can try fancy elaborate games but if you stink and dress like shit, best of luck to you but i dont see it happening. Working as a waiter has definitely forced me to up my grooming by trumming my nails, wearing versace crystal noir and ither fragrances etc. Which i believe is the reason why most girls even if theyre taken at least are willing to have a convo with me.\n\nRejection is the ultimate tool for self development and even though ive been shot down by countless numbers of women in my life, i never let it get me down and im so proud of myself for even having the confidence to speak to these women even though i may not have hollywood good looks or charidma like will smith xD.

She's very talkative now and seems to get along with everyone. Me and her have the same job in our department and I had to train her when she first started. Her mom works there too and asked me to help her daughter get to know the stuff and teach her. \n\nIt's been two months since she's started and she's different from when she first started. I say good morning to her every morning and she has an attitude. (I got this a lot where a girl gets hired and I have to help them, they are always rude to me for no reason, unless the woman is older or its a guy)She's all nice and sweet to everyone else but she's just rude to me. She will take credit from me and blame me when stuff goes wrong(not to my face). \n\nThe moment she is around guys and other people, she belittles me. She talks good about herself, takes my credit then blames me when something goes wrong and everyone in my department goes along with it. Which is wrong, when she is there she doesn't do any work and clowns around with the guys but only when the managers aren't there.The worst part about it is people really like her and think me and her are close friends. They even ask me all the time when she is coming into work.\n\nManagers had to cut off hours due to low sales recently and she was one of them. She was off for three days and the one day she was schedule work, she came in really angry and throwing a fit. She came in complaining to coworkers how she has no days and the days shes does has is only a few hours. Then she starts telling them how they aren't cutting my hours and tells me I won't do any work.   All she does now is complain, complain complain. I've worked with three people before her and we worked good together and I got along with all of them.  So far her hours are still cut and shes there on my days off. I rarely work with her much and its more peaceful. Even after all of her bs talking, she still smiles in my face and act like we are friends.\n\nWhat should I do? \n\n I work with two coworkers, a manager and an employee who hate each other and when they are there , they ignore each other.  I plan on doing this with her. \n\n\n\nTL;DR: Coworker complains about me and falsely accuses me of not doing my work when it's really her.

698;187;158;text;Is my husband simply nonmonogamous and i just can't accept that?;"When i met my husband from our first meet i was crazy about him. He was visiting out of town and we went on a 2 dates before he went back home. We kept in contact on Facebook and started to make plans to see each other due to him saying he really missed me which was mutual. He even said he wanted us to be a couple whenever we were in the same city. however i noticed there was some girl who happened to live in my city he was constantly chatting with and tagging in his facebook posts. Lets call her Jane.\n\n\n I asked him about Jane if there was anything going on between them. He said no and that shes just a friend nothing more than that. He came back and spent  10 days with me. My feelings grew each of those 10 days. After he went back home he was distant i asked what was going on he shockingly told me he wasn't over an exgirlfriend lets call her mary. i than asked him if Jane was really just a friend and nothing more than that. He admitted they are friends now but previously they were exes. he apparently visited her  years ago in 2015 like he did me for 10 days but she told him she had no interest in pursuing the relationship further after he went back home from visiting her. He told me he lied because he didn't want me to think anything was still going on with them romantically still. \n\n\nI tell him take the time to get whatever closure he needs so he can move on from mary and hopefully we can have something one day. He agreed we still kept chatting via facebook where one day he than states hes completely over his ex mary and only has eyes for me but makes the comment it would of been nice to have been with someone 10 years younger than him like she was. Which hurt my feelings but i justified it as him being an idiot. He states he would really Like to finally pursue a relationship with me by relocating to be with me. I agreed we began dating again and went on a vegas trip together. Where it seemed our relationship grew so intense that even i could tell he was crazy about me. Than  One day  he came to visit me we were chilling and i was bored so i asked him to switch phones with me. I had no real suspicions at the time but he gently refused telling me ""there may be things in there i may misunderstand"" i laughed it off and carried on with my day but those words got to me. \n\n\n\nI came back in the room and demanded his phone. He gave it to me. All his conversations with exs mary and jane were deleted. I confronted him about it and he claimed he just didn't want me getting offended by past conversations. I let it go but i asked about mary. He apparently only met mary once but there whole relationship was online. Which made me think it was utterly ridiculous he even called it a relationship. I also  felt particularly uneasy about jane because I remember he particularly lied about them just being friends nothing more than that ever yet he felt the need to delete their convo.  \n\nHe said he could see why i was upset Swore there wasn't anything there he had been unnecessarily paranoid but  blocked her on his fb infront of me for my assurance. I felt great after. The next month he was supposed to visit me but instead said he couldn't make it as he didn't have enough money for a ticket. What i didnt know was that he instead travelled to los Angeles. when i ended up finding out i asked if he went to see a girl  he swore he just wanted to travel there to clear his head. But what i found out was that he visited a women there named misty. \n\n\nHe claimed they were just friends but i was pissed because i never even knew of this alleged friend and you basically chose to see her instead of me. Luckily she was on his snapchat friends list. I confronted misty on snapchatwho told me she never even knew of my name but that nothing ever happened between them and hes never hit on her etc that they have always behaved as friends.  \n\n\nbecause of the deception i demanded he cut communication with her. He agreed to do so but i had a sinking intuition to look in his phone again not just trusting he would do it. I look in his phone and discover that he kept misty on snapchat as well as has secretly kept jane on snapchat all these years. Furious i demand he remove jane for good. He agrees and removes misty as well infront of me.  Fast forward we get married we are happy or so i think. i find a nude picture of an exgirlfriend i never even knew about in his phone lets call her marsha.\n\n\n Marsha is the same story. Online relationship met in person she didn't wanna pursue it further. I confront him he cries for me not to leave him. deletes picture than swears to remove her from all social media applications. But guess what? He secretly keeps her on Instagram. I discover this and raise hell.i make him contact her and tell him to get closure.\n\n\n He basically asks her why she lost interest in him. She explains why he seems to be at peace with the info and the chapter with her closes. Never hear about her again. Fast forward a couple months later our marriage gets very bad i discover hes using snapchat again. I look on it to discover jane on there once again!  We agree to seperate as our marriage was hitting a nose dive in general. 2 months later we get back together. We do intensive therapy and things seem to be great im sooooo happy. On our anniversary month wat do i see on his phone snapchat. I look on it again i see jane but this time i can  look at there conversation history throughout this whole year and last. I Don't see anything flirtatious its all small talk. He doesn't ask her to hang out etc. I message jane this time. \n\n\nShe tells me After she told him she was no longer interested after he visited her that hes never tried to hit on her or asked to see her again or anything inappropriate like that.\n\n All their convos have been platonic and he told her that he was married. From what i could see Most of their old conversation history backs up what she says but it does seem not every snapchat convo was saved.  However im still angry that my husband was still in communication knowing how badly it hurts me. When my husband gets home my rage consumes me  and i scream and yell because he refuses to stay away from her. \n\n\nThis woman is 7 years older than me why can't you let her go? Why am i not enough? He claims hes not in love with her and has no feelings and knew that he shouldn't have hit her up on snapchat wishing her a happy birthday but he did it anyway. Towards the end of our argument my husband deletes snapchat and says he will stay away from her for good.he than says that maybe he will never be able to change into the man i need him to be because he clearly has a problem of letting go of exes and that problem extended to me and maybe he should let me go and i should of stayed his ex. I told him this is the first time he ever admitted there was a problem and maybe now that hes admitted it he can finally get the help towards fixing it through  1on1 therapy.\n\nHis snapchat account is completely deleted this time i verified that and hes doing therapy 1on1 now.  He expressed to the therapist that jane is just a friend to him and that he doesn't have many friends which is why he stayed in contact. but i have always encouraged him to try and make new friends not hold on to these people he was romantically involved with.I am   seeing a lot of positive changes in how marriage oriented he is now and more focused on me. He proudly displays me on social media his close circle of online friends know me. He's more thoughtful of my feelings and is more apologetic than before.  \n\n\n\nI haven't mentioned those improvements in him because my main point of this post is does it sound like my husband is in love with jane? Or does it sound like he has some unhealthy fascination with ""what could of been"" with various women?. I can't help but wonder what is all this? Does he have some wierd fantasy land attachment to women he barely knows? Am i plan b?

699;187;158;text;Is my husband simply nonmonogamous and i just can't accept that?;"When i met my husband from our first meet i was crazy about him. He was visiting out of town and we went on a 2 dates before he went back home. We kept in contact on Facebook and started to make plans to see each other due to him saying he really missed me which was mutual. He even said he wanted us to be a couple whenever we were in the same city. however i noticed there was some girl who happened to live in my city he was constantly chatting with and tagging in his facebook posts. Lets call her Jane.\n\n\n I asked him about Jane if there was anything going on between them. He said no and that shes just a friend nothing more than that. He came back and spent  10 days with me. My feelings grew each of those 10 days. After he went back home he was distant i asked what was going on he shockingly told me he wasn't over an exgirlfriend lets call her mary. i than asked him if Jane was really just a friend and nothing more than that. He admitted they are friends now but previously they were exes. he apparently visited her  years ago in 2015 like he did me for 10 days but she told him she had no interest in pursuing the relationship further after he went back home from visiting her. He told me he lied because he didn't want me to think anything was still going on with them romantically still. \n\n\nI tell him take the time to get whatever closure he needs so he can move on from mary and hopefully we can have something one day. He agreed we still kept chatting via facebook where one day he than states hes completely over his ex mary and only has eyes for me but makes the comment it would of been nice to have been with someone 10 years younger than him like she was. Which hurt my feelings but i justified it as him being an idiot. He states he would really Like to finally pursue a relationship with me by relocating to be with me. I agreed we began dating again and went on a vegas trip together. Where it seemed our relationship grew so intense that even i could tell he was crazy about me. Than  One day  he came to visit me we were chilling and i was bored so i asked him to switch phones with me. I had no real suspicions at the time but he gently refused telling me ""there may be things in there i may misunderstand"" i laughed it off and carried on with my day but those words got to me. \n\n\n\nI came back in the room and demanded his phone. He gave it to me. All his conversations with exs mary and jane were deleted. I confronted him about it and he claimed he just didn't want me getting offended by past conversations. I let it go but i asked about mary. He apparently only met mary once but there whole relationship was online. Which made me think it was utterly ridiculous he even called it a relationship. I also  felt particularly uneasy about jane because I remember he particularly lied about them just being friends nothing more than that ever yet he felt the need to delete their convo.  \n\nHe said he could see why i was upset Swore there wasn't anything there he had been unnecessarily paranoid but  blocked her on his fb infront of me for my assurance. I felt great after. The next month he was supposed to visit me but instead said he couldn't make it as he didn't have enough money for a ticket. What i didnt know was that he instead travelled to los Angeles. when i ended up finding out i asked if he went to see a girl  he swore he just wanted to travel there to clear his head. But what i found out was that he visited a women there named misty. \n\n\nHe claimed they were just friends but i was pissed because i never even knew of this alleged friend and you basically chose to see her instead of me. Luckily she was on his snapchat friends list. I confronted misty on snapchatwho told me she never even knew of my name but that nothing ever happened between them and hes never hit on her etc that they have always behaved as friends.  \n\n\nbecause of the deception i demanded he cut communication with her. He agreed to do so but i had a sinking intuition to look in his phone again not just trusting he would do it. I look in his phone and discover that he kept misty on snapchat as well as has secretly kept jane on snapchat all these years. Furious i demand he remove jane for good. He agrees and removes misty as well infront of me.  Fast forward we get married we are happy or so i think. i find a nude picture of an exgirlfriend i never even knew about in his phone lets call her marsha.\n\n\n Marsha is the same story. Online relationship met in person she didn't wanna pursue it further. I confront him he cries for me not to leave him. deletes picture than swears to remove her from all social media applications. But guess what? He secretly keeps her on Instagram. I discover this and raise hell.i make him contact her and tell him to get closure.\n\n\n He basically asks her why she lost interest in him. She explains why he seems to be at peace with the info and the chapter with her closes. Never hear about her again. Fast forward a couple months later our marriage gets very bad i discover hes using snapchat again. I look on it to discover jane on there once again!  We agree to seperate as our marriage was hitting a nose dive in general. 2 months later we get back together. We do intensive therapy and things seem to be great im sooooo happy.

703;187;158;text;Is my husband simply nonmonogamous and i just can't accept that?;"When i met my husband from our first meet i was crazy about him. He was visiting out of town and we went on a 2 dates before he went back home. We kept in contact on Facebook and started to make plans to see each other due to him saying he really missed me which was mutual. He even said he wanted us to be a couple whenever we were in the same city. however i noticed there was some girl who happened to live in my city he was constantly chatting with and tagging in his facebook posts. Lets call her Jane.\n\n\n I asked him about Jane if there was anything going on between them. He said no and that shes just a friend nothing more than that. He came back and spent  10 days with me. My feelings grew each of those 10 days. After he went back home he was distant i asked what was going on he shockingly told me he wasn't over an exgirlfriend lets call her mary. i than asked him if Jane was really just a friend and nothing more than that. He admitted they are friends now but previously they were exes. he apparently visited her  years ago in 2015 like he did me for 10 days but she told him she had no interest in pursuing the relationship further after he went back home from visiting her. He told me he lied because he didn't want me to think anything was still going on with them romantically still. \n\n\nI tell him take the time to get whatever closure he needs so he can move on from mary and hopefully we can have something one day. He agreed we still kept chatting via facebook where one day he than states hes completely over his ex mary and only has eyes for me but makes the comment it would of been nice to have been with someone 10 years younger than him like she was. Which hurt my feelings but i justified it as him being an idiot. He states he would really Like to finally pursue a relationship with me by relocating to be with me. I agreed we began dating again and went on a vegas trip together. Where it seemed our relationship grew so intense that even i could tell he was crazy about me. Than  One day  he came to visit me we were chilling and i was bored so i asked him to switch phones with me. I had no real suspicions at the time but he gently refused telling me ""there may be things in there i may misunderstand"" i laughed it off and carried on with my day but those words got to me. \n\n\n\nI came back in the room and demanded his phone. He gave it to me. All his conversations with exs mary and jane were deleted. I confronted him about it and he claimed he just didn't want me getting offended by past conversations. I let it go but i asked about mary. He apparently only met mary once but there whole relationship was online. Which made me think it was utterly ridiculous he even called it a relationship. I also  felt particularly uneasy about jane because I remember he particularly lied about them just being friends nothing more than that ever yet he felt the need to delete their convo.  \n\nHe said he could see why i was upset Swore there wasn't anything there he had been unnecessarily paranoid but  blocked her on his fb infront of me for my assurance. I felt great after. The next month he was supposed to visit me but instead said he couldn't make it as he didn't have enough money for a ticket. What i didnt know was that he instead travelled to los Angeles. when i ended up finding out i asked if he went to see a girl  he swore he just wanted to travel there to clear his head. But what i found out was that he visited a women there named misty. \n\n\nHe claimed they were just friends but i was pissed because i never even knew of this alleged friend and you basically chose to see her instead of me. Luckily she was on his snapchat friends list. I confronted misty on snapchatwho told me she never even knew of my name but that nothing ever happened between them and hes never hit on her etc that they have always behaved as friends.  \n\n\nbecause of the deception i demanded he cut communication with her. He agreed to do so but i had a sinking intuition to look in his phone again not just trusting he would do it. I look in his phone and discover that he kept misty on snapchat as well as has secretly kept jane on snapchat all these years. Furious i demand he remove jane for good. He agrees and removes misty as well infront of me.  Fast forward we get married we are happy or so i think. i find a nude picture of an exgirlfriend i never even knew about in his phone lets call her marsha.\n\n\n Marsha is the same story. Online relationship met in person she didn't wanna pursue it further. I confront him he cries for me not to leave him. deletes picture than swears to remove her from all social media applications. But guess what? He secretly keeps her on Instagram. I discover this and raise hell.i make him contact her and tell him to get closure.\n\n\n He basically asks her why she lost interest in him. She explains why he seems to be at peace with the info and the chapter with her closes. Never hear about her again. Fast forward a couple months later our marriage gets very bad i discover hes using snapchat again. I look on it to discover jane on there once again!  We agree to seperate as our marriage was hitting a nose dive in general. 2 months later we get back together. We do intensive therapy and things seem to be great im sooooo happy. On our anniversary month wat do i see on his phone snapchat. I look on it again i see jane but this time i can  look at there conversation history throughout this whole year and last. I Don't see anything flirtatious its all small talk. He doesn't ask her to hang out etc. I message jane this time. \n\n\nShe tells me After she told him she was no longer interested after he visited her that hes never tried to hit on her or asked to see her again or anything inappropriate like that.\n\n All their convos have been platonic and he told her that he was married. From what i could see Most of their old conversation history backs up what she says but it does seem not every snapchat convo was saved.  However im still angry that my husband was still in communication knowing how badly it hurts me. When my husband gets home my rage consumes me  and i scream and yell because he refuses to stay away from her. \n\n\nThis woman is 7 years older than me why can't you let her go? Why am i not enough?

722;193;163;text;Need advice with boyfriend who is lacking ambition.;Sorry for the long post but I have to explain. Im active duty in the military been in for a little over 2 years, Ive been with my boyfriend since before I joined almost for three years and we have a 1 year old son. Im 21 hes about to be 23, my issue is that he seens to have no ambition anymore, he doesnt work and doesnt make an effort to finish school, even small trade schools for a certification as an emt, he failed it the first time by 2 points and I think he fears failure that he doesnt really want to try anything anymore. Hes been unemployed for over a year now and failed that school almost a year ago. We always talk about the future because I dont want to have to reenlist but he just sits at home and plays video games all night, wakes up late and takes care of our son. He is madly in love with me and hes a great father. When I talk to him about applying to nursing school while Im working so that by the time I'm out he can have his career going and I can finish school he tells me hes going to do it and finish. (he has already done 2 years of school just needs to do the important last 2 years in order to get his BSN) I feel like he just says hes going to do it in order to get me to stop nagging him. He has reached out to some schools they called him back to make an appointment but its been a couple weeks and he hasnt made the appointment. He doesnt have to excuse that he has to babysit becuase we have a friend who lives with us to babysit when we cant, he just hasnt taken advantage of this time. Its really frustrating to me and I dont know what to do about it anymore. Ive been supporting him for over a year, but at this point even if he was going to school full time now, we would both be without a job by the time I get out of the military. I've told him that his lack of effort makes me feel like he really doesnt care about our family. And I can see that he genuinely feels bad about himself, hes pretty sensitive about the situation but I just need him to grow up and do the work. \n\nHe plays videos games every night and for a little bit during the day, its frusturating to me because hes wasting time. I have told him in the past that he can play as long as he handels business first, like doing school or house chores but he barely does that. Its really hard for me not to feel resentful towards him when he gets to be with our son 24/7 and he wakes up whenever he wants and doesnt pay any bills. I know it sounds bad, it kindof is and I cant really defend him, he cooks for me but I'm tired of making excuses for him to our families so when they ask I tell them to ask him themselves. \n\nShort version: boyfriend who is father of our 1 year old son, doesnt have motivation to finish school, stays at home takes care of our son and plays video games all night, sometimes all day.

887;227;192;text;A tale of how my use of Sprog poems drove a friend of mine to leave a group chat. Featuring nine poems! [long];"Before I begin my tale, a little bit of backstory. I found out about this sub yesterday and since then I have fallen even more in love with this poem than I was before. This has caused me to compose quite a lot, a fact which has not gone over fantastically with my friends, as you shall see.\n\nOur tale begins with a simple poem concerning a [well known figure](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/205/707/c0b.jpg) in Internet culture. This poem went as follows:\n\n > my name is frog    \n > i liek to pley    \n > owt in the rein    \n > al nite and dey    \n > my skin is green    \n > my face is coi    \n > u look and sey    \n > here come dat boi\n\nThis was received rather poorly, earning me some disapproving comments. So I retaliated:\n\n > my name is [name]    \n > u dont think gud    \n > of poems myne -    \n > i sey u shud    \n > u laf and mok    \n > and rage but i    \n > still poem strong.    \n > from me, goodbai \n\nThis second poem was received about as well as the first one. Friend A, who was the only one active at this point, responded by sending an angry reaction image, a screenshot of the character [Blake](https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby/images/d/d3/Blake_ProfilePic_Timeskip_1.png/revision/latest?cb=20170118200619) from the anime RWBY. I replied in kind:\n\n > i see a blek    \n > she is a cat    \n > from [Friend A] sent    \n > gud is not that    \n > she come so quik    \n > she leev so swift    \n > yet never gon    \n > wen [Friend A] mift    \n\nBy this point, a second friend (Friend B) had arrived on the scene and provided his reaction through a photo of an angry character from the manga Berserk. Once again, I responded with a poem:\n\n > berserk i see    \n > tis [Friend B]'s wey    \n > of seying no    \n > and he dont pley    \n > he dont approv    \n > of meming gud    \n > he must relax    \n > lern how he shud\n\nFriend B reacted to this as you might expect, sending a photo of a hellish dog. As I was composing, Friend C arrived and praised my poetry. Friend B did not like this one bit, but luckily my composition was finished before things got too out of hand:\n\n > a doggo big    \n > with smoaky breth    \n > he huff n puff    \n > he bringin deth    \n > his eys r mad    \n > his teeth will hurt    \n > he gard the hel    \n > he is alert\n\nAfter this, Friend B is low key threatening me, saying that this will not end well and the like. But I am on a roll. I am not giving in. So I tell him exactly where this will end:\n\n > i poem wel    \n > i think i mite    \n > compile a buk    \n > to read at nite    \n > u disaproov    \n > u disagree    \n > but dream wil work    \n > and then u see\n\nFriend B is properly annoyed at this point, and in an attempt to scare me off sends a pretty NSFW image, telling me to ""write a poem on this b*tch"". To what I imagine is his surprise, I comply. I won't link the image or transcribe the poem for this, just to be on the safe side, though I think the poem in and of itself is ok.\n\nAt this point Friend A has returned and is commenting on the image Friend B sent. Friend B mentions an experiment he did involving ticks, Friend A wishes I would get covered in tics, and I have yet another poem for them:\n\n > my name is tick    \n > and wen u see    \n > my population    \n > densitee    \n > u tel ur fren    \n > ""drag urself thru""    \n > but u not know    \n > i come for u    \n\nFriend A has no response other than a picture of Poison Ivy, exasperated and annoyed. I waste no time:\n\n > u poke my face    \n > i not amuse    \n > u ask to do    \n > i must refuse    \n > my theem is green    \n > my hair is red    \n > if u dont stop    \n > u die in bed\n\nThere is silence on the chat for about five minutes, until Friend C returns and announces that he is watching Rick and Morty. So what do I do? Well, I Sprog-ify everyone's favourite Rick and Morty copypasta:\n\n > a hi iq    \n > is necess'ry    \n > in glory al    \n > this show to see    \n > it fyzix joke    \n > it siens pun    \n > u need to know    \n > to hav the fun    \n\nFor Friend A, this was the last straw. Without another word, he simply left the chat.\n\nThus ends the tale. I hope I didn't bore you. I hope all my formatting worked out well. If you want to know what the kinda NSFW poem said, feel free to message me and I shall relate it to you.\n\nThank you all for your time and patience, have a good whatever-time-of-day-it-is-when-you're-reading-this.

This poem went as follows:\n\n > my name is frog    \n > i liek to pley    \n > owt in the rein    \n > al nite and dey    \n > my skin is green    \n > my face is coi    \n > u look and sey    \n > here come dat boi\n\nThis was received rather poorly, earning me some disapproving comments. So I retaliated:\n\n > my name is [name]    \n > u dont think gud    \n > of poems myne -    \n > i sey u shud    \n > u laf and mok    \n > and rage but i    \n > still poem strong.    \n > from me, goodbai \n\nThis second poem was received about as well as the first one. Friend A, who was the only one active at this point, responded by sending an angry reaction image, a screenshot of the character [Blake](https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby/images/d/d3/Blake_ProfilePic_Timeskip_1.png/revision/latest?cb=20170118200619) from the anime RWBY. I replied in kind:\n\n > i see a blek    \n > she is a cat    \n > from [Friend A] sent    \n > gud is not that    \n > she come so quik    \n > she leev so swift    \n > yet never gon    \n > wen [Friend A] mift    \n\nBy this point, a second friend (Friend B) had arrived on the scene and provided his reaction through a photo of an angry character from the manga Berserk. Once again, I responded with a poem:\n\n > berserk i see    \n > tis [Friend B]'s wey    \n > of seying no    \n > and he dont pley    \n > he dont approv    \n > of meming gud    \n > he must relax    \n > lern how he shud\n\nFriend B reacted to this as you might expect, sending a photo of a hellish dog. As I was composing, Friend C arrived and praised my poetry. Friend B did not like this one bit, but luckily my composition was finished before things got too out of hand:\n\n > a doggo big    \n > with smoaky breth    \n > he huff n puff    \n > he bringin deth    \n > his eys r mad    \n > his teeth will hurt    \n > he gard the hel    \n > he is alert\n\nAfter this, Friend B is low key threatening me, saying that this will not end well and the like. But I am on a roll. I am not giving in. So I tell him exactly where this will end:\n\n > i poem wel    \n > i think i mite    \n > compile a buk    \n > to read at nite    \n > u disaproov    \n > u disagree    \n > but dream wil work    \n > and then u see\n\nFriend B is properly annoyed at this point, and in an attempt to scare me off sends a pretty NSFW image, telling me to ""write a poem on this b*tch"". To what I imagine is his surprise, I comply. I won't link the image or transcribe the poem for this, just to be on the safe side, though I think the poem in and of itself is ok.\n\nAt this point Friend A has returned and is commenting on the image Friend B sent. Friend B mentions an experiment he did involving ticks, Friend A wishes I would get covered in tics, and I have yet another poem for them:\n\n > my name is tick    \n > and wen u see    \n > my population    \n > densitee    \n > u tel ur fren    \n > ""drag urself thru""    \n > but u not know    \n > i come for u    \n\nFriend A has no response other than a picture of Poison Ivy, exasperated and annoyed. I waste no time:\n\n > u poke my face    \n > i not amuse    \n > u ask to do    \n > i must refuse    \n > my theem is green    \n > my hair is red    \n > if u dont stop    \n > u die in bed\n\nThere is silence on the chat for about five minutes, until Friend C returns and announces that he is watching Rick and Morty. So what do I do? Well, I Sprog-ify everyone's favourite Rick and Morty copypasta:\n\n > a hi iq    \n > is necess'ry    \n > in glory al    \n > this show to see    \n > it fyzix joke    \n > it siens pun    \n > u need to know    \n > to hav the fun    \n\nFor Friend A, this was the last straw. Without another word, he simply left the chat.\n\nThus ends the tale. I hope I didn't bore you. I hope all my formatting worked out well. If you want to know what the kinda NSFW poem said, feel free to message me and I shall relate it to you.\n\nThank you all for your time and patience, have a good whatever-time-of-day-it-is-when-you're-reading-this.

So I retaliated:\n\n > my name is [name]    \n > u dont think gud    \n > of poems myne -    \n > i sey u shud    \n > u laf and mok    \n > and rage but i    \n > still poem strong.    \n > from me, goodbai \n\nThis second poem was received about as well as the first one. Friend A, who was the only one active at this point, responded by sending an angry reaction image, a screenshot of the character [Blake](https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby/images/d/d3/Blake_ProfilePic_Timeskip_1.png/revision/latest?cb=20170118200619) from the anime RWBY. I replied in kind:\n\n > i see a blek    \n > she is a cat    \n > from [Friend A] sent    \n > gud is not that    \n > she come so quik    \n > she leev so swift    \n > yet never gon    \n > wen [Friend A] mift    \n\nBy this point, a second friend (Friend B) had arrived on the scene and provided his reaction through a photo of an angry character from the manga Berserk. Once again, I responded with a poem:\n\n > berserk i see    \n > tis [Friend B]'s wey    \n > of seying no    \n > and he dont pley    \n > he dont approv    \n > of meming gud    \n > he must relax    \n > lern how he shud\n\nFriend B reacted to this as you might expect, sending a photo of a hellish dog. As I was composing, Friend C arrived and praised my poetry. Friend B did not like this one bit, but luckily my composition was finished before things got too out of hand:\n\n > a doggo big    \n > with smoaky breth    \n > he huff n puff    \n > he bringin deth    \n > his eys r mad    \n > his teeth will hurt    \n > he gard the hel    \n > he is alert\n\nAfter this, Friend B is low key threatening me, saying that this will not end well and the like. But I am on a roll. I am not giving in. So I tell him exactly where this will end:\n\n > i poem wel    \n > i think i mite    \n > compile a buk    \n > to read at nite    \n > u disaproov    \n > u disagree    \n > but dream wil work    \n > and then u see\n\nFriend B is properly annoyed at this point, and in an attempt to scare me off sends a pretty NSFW image, telling me to ""write a poem on this b*tch"". To what I imagine is his surprise, I comply. I won't link the image or transcribe the poem for this, just to be on the safe side, though I think the poem in and of itself is ok.\n\nAt this point Friend A has returned and is commenting on the image Friend B sent. Friend B mentions an experiment he did involving ticks, Friend A wishes I would get covered in tics, and I have yet another poem for them:\n\n > my name is tick    \n > and wen u see    \n > my population    \n > densitee    \n > u tel ur fren    \n > ""drag urself thru""    \n > but u not know    \n > i come for u    \n\nFriend A has no response other than a picture of Poison Ivy, exasperated and annoyed. I waste no time:\n\n > u poke my face    \n > i not amuse    \n > u ask to do    \n > i must refuse    \n > my theem is green    \n > my hair is red    \n > if u dont stop    \n > u die in bed\n\nThere is silence on the chat for about five minutes, until Friend C returns and announces that he is watching Rick and Morty. So what do I do? Well, I Sprog-ify everyone's favourite Rick and Morty copypasta:\n\n > a hi iq    \n > is necess'ry    \n > in glory al    \n > this show to see    \n > it fyzix joke    \n > it siens pun    \n > u need to know    \n > to hav the fun    \n\nFor Friend A, this was the last straw. Without another word, he simply left the chat.\n\nThus ends the tale. I hope I didn't bore you. I hope all my formatting worked out well. If you want to know what the kinda NSFW poem said, feel free to message me and I shall relate it to you.\n\nThank you all for your time and patience, have a good whatever-time-of-day-it-is-when-you're-reading-this.

901;228;193;text;The holy trio LFK;Arent u all tired of seeing atleast the first two jumping into battle and wiping out ur whole team in an instant? I’ve heard somewhere about people saying if they werent here then well the game would be balanced, well i beg to differ cos theres akai with his insane disruption and diggie with his timely ulti or maybe even irithel might be banned cos of her deadly ability to snowball and splash ult. Back to the topic. Honestly the king and queen of this game is lancelot and his beloved fanny. Maybe kagura is like a princess. These 3 are the ones that give everyone trouble the most. The moment u ban 2 of them u will think oh shit the enemy is gonna take the third one unless the enemy team is a complete full. Lancelot and fanny insane cos they are assassins but they can wipe out the entire team including tanks. Nerfing fanny’s energy has no point. Nerfing her damage wud make more sense.

And that he's sorry for talking like this but he took some pills that he found on the floor.\n\nI said ""don't confuse me."" And that taking drugs on the floor is completely stupid. Honestly, I dont buy that he was on drugs because he told me he only does edibles and he would never do anything other than that . I asked him ""what pill? From where?""\nHe said ""shhh just kis me you fool"".\n\nI still love him and I cried so much on valentine's weekend (dont judge lmao) , but I said ""No. You're f***ed up now. Whats going on?""\n\nHe never replied to me afterwards, and this interaction took about 10 minutes through text.\n\n\nToday he says ""good lord wtf happened. I gotta garden ttyl"".\n\nHe read my reply which said ""I'm so worried about you! Why would you take that? Where did you find it and why would you take it? Eat and stay hydrated"".\n\nI just don't know anymore. I suspected it, but I want him to be upfront about it with me. I love him and he will always be my first and I'll always talk to him and care for him,  but I don't want to be held in limbo. I'm trying to move on and this is now in my head.\n\nWhat are your thoughts fellow friends? Tell me anything. Your opinion, what you think I should do, and how to approach this. I'm lost. \n\n*My post about my suspicions a couple weeks ago:*\nWe were in an LDR. About 5 weeks ago, he broke up with me. Saying he ""became cold with everyone and lost love for everything"". He is a depressed and anxious person, so I asked again if that's what he wants and he said he sees me as a friend. But afterwards he told me, ""he loves me, just not as much as he remembers"". I was torn, but I respected his decision. His attitude seems better than then, but I still can't get over it. He is my first boyfriend and I truly adore him. The relationship was about 3 months haha but I loved it. But even now that we are exes, he has brought things that just confuses me.  Also, we talk literally everyday, for the past 5 months.\nBut some things don't add up to me? I feel like deep down, he likes me? Idk though since this was my first relationship ever.\n1. He said I look like a cake. [I actually dont know what that means😂]. I said ""are you calling my skin grossly textured? Imma fight you!"" He said to me ""you hella cute, and that you need to shaddap"". \n-- I said I gtg to work now cause I'm afraid that a coworker is gonna fight me. Idk if I upset him by saying that? But it was true!  Cause he didn't text me for a whole day afterwards lmao.\n\n2. Said he was eating enchiladas. I said I like em spicy, ""but I can't handle all the fire"". To which he replied ""YoU cAn HaNdLe ThIs DiCk. They weren't that spicy"". I was like what in tarnation? 👀😂\n\n3. He'll tell me about his cats. If he slept. If he ate. I ask him sometimes too, cause he is an insomniac and bad eater. \n\n4  One time he called me hairy and I was like ""Hitting me where it hurts! (I'm middle eastern lmao 😂) Have you seen my brows though?"" He said show me. I did, with a middle finger. But that time he said ""I asked for a picture of brows, not the finger you use to touch yourself"". Not gonna lie, that pissed me off... I said  ""Why would you say that, you weirdo!? I did that cause you called me hairy?🤨😅"". I sent him a blow up of my brows from the same picture, and he said ""garbage"". And I said ""ok"". Then he didn't text me for 1.5 hours. He replied with ""WYD"". and I said ""chilling"".\n-- him going wyd is his way of saying ""I did wrong"".\n\n5. We talked on the phone for 3 hours 2 weeks ago, and we had fun.  He brought it up though! I always brought up phone calls! \n\n6. I asked him if he seen gameplay of the new Resident Evil game, and he said ""we watched the first movie"". And I said ""ohh yeahh"". I was surprised cause I honestly BARELY remember. 😂 I told him 7 and the new one were supposed to be pretty good, and that I'll keep up with him if he wants. He decided to watch some resident evil 7 gameplays. A couple days later, heasked me if I wanted to watch some with him and I agreed. But I assume he fell asleep midway thru the first video? 😅 I was happy he was asleep and getting peace though. \n\n7. If its late (I'm 2 hrs ahead of him) and I'm up, he'll tell me to go to sleep cause its late.\n\nAnyhow, I'm confused of why we talk to each other like this? My sister says ""he likes me, but he needs time to figure himself out cause he is a hot mess"". He definitely is. She told me to treat this like a break. But sometimes I still cry cause I really fell hard for him and I wish I'd forget. \nI know some exes decide never to speak or see each other again, but I can't do that. And I don't think he would want that too. He acts tough, but he is so sensitive. Ughh I hate myself 🙈\n\nAnyhow, what does all this mean? I feel so inclined to be like ""yooo you still like me or what?"" But I am not the kind to proclaim feelings like that 😨 Do exes ever get back together?";"He said ""shhh just kis me you fool"".";He said “shh, just kiss me you fool”.;Řekl „pšt, prostě mě polib, blázínku“.;;;FALSE

I love him and he will always be my first and I'll always talk to him and care for him,  but I don't want to be held in limbo. I'm trying to move on and this is now in my head.\n\nWhat are your thoughts fellow friends? Tell me anything. Your opinion, what you think I should do, and how to approach this. I'm lost. \n\n*My post about my suspicions a couple weeks ago:*\nWe were in an LDR. About 5 weeks ago, he broke up with me. Saying he ""became cold with everyone and lost love for everything"". He is a depressed and anxious person, so I asked again if that's what he wants and he said he sees me as a friend. But afterwards he told me, ""he loves me, just not as much as he remembers"". I was torn, but I respected his decision. His attitude seems better than then, but I still can't get over it. He is my first boyfriend and I truly adore him. The relationship was about 3 months haha but I loved it. But even now that we are exes, he has brought things that just confuses me.  Also, we talk literally everyday, for the past 5 months.\nBut some things don't add up to me? I feel like deep down, he likes me? Idk though since this was my first relationship ever.\n1. He said I look like a cake. [I actually dont know what that means😂]. I said ""are you calling my skin grossly textured? Imma fight you!"" He said to me ""you hella cute, and that you need to shaddap"". \n-- I said I gtg to work now cause I'm afraid that a coworker is gonna fight me. Idk if I upset him by saying that? But it was true!  Cause he didn't text me for a whole day afterwards lmao.\n\n2. Said he was eating enchiladas. I said I like em spicy, ""but I can't handle all the fire"". To which he replied ""YoU cAn HaNdLe ThIs DiCk. They weren't that spicy"". I was like what in tarnation? 👀😂\n\n3. He'll tell me about his cats. If he slept. If he ate. I ask him sometimes too, cause he is an insomniac and bad eater. \n\n4  One time he called me hairy and I was like ""Hitting me where it hurts! (I'm middle eastern lmao 😂) Have you seen my brows though?"" He said show me. I did, with a middle finger. But that time he said ""I asked for a picture of brows, not the finger you use to touch yourself"". Not gonna lie, that pissed me off... I said  ""Why would you say that, you weirdo!? I did that cause you called me hairy?🤨😅"". I sent him a blow up of my brows from the same picture, and he said ""garbage"". And I said ""ok"". Then he didn't text me for 1.5 hours. He replied with ""WYD"". and I said ""chilling"".\n-- him going wyd is his way of saying ""I did wrong"".\n\n5. We talked on the phone for 3 hours 2 weeks ago, and we had fun.  He brought it up though! I always brought up phone calls! \n\n6. I asked him if he seen gameplay of the new Resident Evil game, and he said ""we watched the first movie"". And I said ""ohh yeahh"". I was surprised cause I honestly BARELY remember. 😂 I told him 7 and the new one were supposed to be pretty good, and that I'll keep up with him if he wants. He decided to watch some resident evil 7 gameplays. A couple days later, heasked me if I wanted to watch some with him and I agreed. But I assume he fell asleep midway thru the first video? 😅 I was happy he was asleep and getting peace though. \n\n7. If its late (I'm 2 hrs ahead of him) and I'm up, he'll tell me to go to sleep cause its late.\n\nAnyhow, I'm confused of why we talk to each other like this? My sister says ""he likes me, but he needs time to figure himself out cause he is a hot mess"". He definitely is. She told me to treat this like a break. But sometimes I still cry cause I really fell hard for him and I wish I'd forget. \nI know some exes decide never to speak or see each other again, but I can't do that. And I don't think he would want that too. He acts tough, but he is so sensitive. Ughh I hate myself 🙈\n\nAnyhow, what does all this mean? I feel so inclined to be like ""yooo you still like me or what?"" But I am not the kind to proclaim feelings like that 😨 Do exes ever get back together?";"I still love him and I cried so much on valentine's weekend (dont judge lmao) , but I said ""No. You're f***ed up now.";I still love him and I cried so much on Valentine’s weekend (don’t judge, lmao), but I said “No. You’re fucked up now.;Pořád ho miluju a o víkendu na Valentýna jsem děsně brečela (nesuďte mě, lmao), ale odpověděla jsem: „Ne.

He replied with ""WYD"". and I said ""chilling"".\n-- him going wyd is his way of saying ""I did wrong"".\n\n5. We talked on the phone for 3 hours 2 weeks ago, and we had fun.  He brought it up though! I always brought up phone calls! \n\n6. I asked him if he seen gameplay of the new Resident Evil game, and he said ""we watched the first movie"". And I said ""ohh yeahh"". I was surprised cause I honestly BARELY remember. 😂 I told him 7 and the new one were supposed to be pretty good, and that I'll keep up with him if he wants. He decided to watch some resident evil 7 gameplays. A couple days later, heasked me if I wanted to watch some with him and I agreed. But I assume he fell asleep midway thru the first video? 😅 I was happy he was asleep and getting peace though. \n\n7. If its late (I'm 2 hrs ahead of him) and I'm up, he'll tell me to go to sleep cause its late.\n\nAnyhow, I'm confused of why we talk to each other like this? My sister says ""he likes me, but he needs time to figure himself out cause he is a hot mess"". He definitely is. She told me to treat this like a break. But sometimes I still cry cause I really fell hard for him and I wish I'd forget. \nI know some exes decide never to speak or see each other again, but I can't do that. And I don't think he would want that too. He acts tough, but he is so sensitive. Ughh I hate myself 🙈\n\nAnyhow, what does all this mean? I feel so inclined to be like ""yooo you still like me or what?""

It went like this:\n\nHe said I wasn't a 10, and I said ok cause I was lowkey butthurt lmao. But then he said ""boom roasted"". \nI said ""you're not stupid, but that was stupid"".\nHe said ""no, u.""\nI said ""silence stupid"" and he said ""silence thot"".\nI told him ""liisten liinda. Ima curb yo ass"".\nTo which he said ""shut your soft ass up. Good night.""\n*he will always talk about my small butt and he knows I wish I had a big one like his 🤣\n""I said imma kick your bubble butt. Good night and sleep well.""\nHe said ""sorry you have no ass"" and I said\n""I'm sorry too lmao but at least I have a good personality 👀👀🤣🤣""\n\nThen he goes totally different!********\nHe said:\n""Mmm and nice t*ts"" \nI said ""uhh what?""\nHe said ""hmm?""\nI asked him ""why would you say that?""\nHe told me ""its cause you have nice ones g""\nI tried brushing it off like ""Lmao that is so weird but thanks 😂""\nThen he told me he still wants me to take his virginity. And that he's sorry for talking like this but he took some pills that he found on the floor.\n\nI said ""don't confuse me."" And that taking drugs on the floor is completely stupid. Honestly, I dont buy that he was on drugs because he told me he only does edibles and he would never do anything other than that . I asked him ""what pill? From where?""\nHe said ""shhh just kis me you fool"".\n\nI still love him and I cried so much on valentine's weekend (dont judge lmao) , but I said ""No. You're f***ed up now. Whats going on?""\n\nHe never replied to me afterwards, and this interaction took about 10 minutes through text.\n\n\nToday he says ""good lord wtf happened. I gotta garden ttyl"".\n\nHe read my reply which said ""I'm so worried about you! Why would you take that? Where did you find it and why would you take it? Eat and stay hydrated"".\n\nI just don't know anymore. I suspected it, but I want him to be upfront about it with me. I love him and he will always be my first and I'll always talk to him and care for him,  but I don't want to be held in limbo. I'm trying to move on and this is now in my head.\n\nWhat are your thoughts fellow friends? Tell me anything. Your opinion, what you think I should do, and how to approach this. I'm lost. \n\n*My post about my suspicions a couple weeks ago:*\nWe were in an LDR. About 5 weeks ago, he broke up with me. Saying he ""became cold with everyone and lost love for everything"". He is a depressed and anxious person, so I asked again if that's what he wants and he said he sees me as a friend. But afterwards he told me, ""he loves me, just not as much as he remembers"". I was torn, but I respected his decision. His attitude seems better than then, but I still can't get over it. He is my first boyfriend and I truly adore him. The relationship was about 3 months haha but I loved it. But even now that we are exes, he has brought things that just confuses me.  Also, we talk literally everyday, for the past 5 months.\nBut some things don't add up to me? I feel like deep down, he likes me? Idk though since this was my first relationship ever.\n1. He said I look like a cake. [I actually dont know what that means😂]. I said ""are you calling my skin grossly textured? Imma fight you!"" He said to me ""you hella cute, and that you need to shaddap"". \n-- I said I gtg to work now cause I'm afraid that a coworker is gonna fight me. Idk if I upset him by saying that? But it was true!  Cause he didn't text me for a whole day afterwards lmao.\n\n2. Said he was eating enchiladas. I said I like em spicy, ""but I can't handle all the fire"". To which he replied ""YoU cAn HaNdLe ThIs DiCk. They weren't that spicy"". I was like what in tarnation? 👀😂\n\n3. He'll tell me about his cats. If he slept. If he ate. I ask him sometimes too, cause he is an insomniac and bad eater. \n\n4  One time he called me hairy and I was like ""Hitting me where it hurts! (I'm middle eastern lmao 😂) Have you seen my brows though?"" He said show me. I did, with a middle finger. But that time he said ""I asked for a picture of brows, not the finger you use to touch yourself"". Not gonna lie, that pissed me off... I said  ""Why would you say that, you weirdo!?

And that he's sorry for talking like this but he took some pills that he found on the floor.\n\nI said ""don't confuse me."" And that taking drugs on the floor is completely stupid.

I love him and he will always be my first and I'll always talk to him and care for him,  but I don't want to be held in limbo. I'm trying to move on and this is now in my head.\n\nWhat are your thoughts fellow friends? Tell me anything. Your opinion, what you think I should do, and how to approach this. I'm lost. \n\n*My post about my suspicions a couple weeks ago:*\nWe were in an LDR. About 5 weeks ago, he broke up with me. Saying he ""became cold with everyone and lost love for everything"". He is a depressed and anxious person, so I asked again if that's what he wants and he said he sees me as a friend. But afterwards he told me, ""he loves me, just not as much as he remembers"". I was torn, but I respected his decision. His attitude seems better than then, but I still can't get over it. He is my first boyfriend and I truly adore him. The relationship was about 3 months haha but I loved it. But even now that we are exes, he has brought things that just confuses me.  Also, we talk literally everyday, for the past 5 months.\nBut some things don't add up to me? I feel like deep down, he likes me? Idk though since this was my first relationship ever.\n1. He said I look like a cake. [I actually dont know what that means😂]. I said ""are you calling my skin grossly textured? Imma fight you!"" He said to me ""you hella cute, and that you need to shaddap"". \n-- I said I gtg to work now cause I'm afraid that a coworker is gonna fight me. Idk if I upset him by saying that? But it was true!  Cause he didn't text me for a whole day afterwards lmao.\n\n2. Said he was eating enchiladas. I said I like em spicy, ""but I can't handle all the fire"". To which he replied ""YoU cAn HaNdLe ThIs DiCk. They weren't that spicy"". I was like what in tarnation? 👀😂\n\n3. He'll tell me about his cats. If he slept. If he ate. I ask him sometimes too, cause he is an insomniac and bad eater. \n\n4  One time he called me hairy and I was like ""Hitting me where it hurts! (I'm middle eastern lmao 😂) Have you seen my brows though?"" He said show me. I did, with a middle finger. But that time he said ""I asked for a picture of brows, not the finger you use to touch yourself"". Not gonna lie, that pissed me off... I said  ""Why would you say that, you weirdo!? I did that cause you called me hairy?🤨😅"". I sent him a blow up of my brows from the same picture, and he said ""garbage"". And I said ""ok"". Then he didn't text me for 1.5 hours. He replied with ""WYD"". and I said ""chilling"".\n-- him going wyd is his way of saying ""I did wrong"".\n\n5. We talked on the phone for 3 hours 2 weeks ago, and we had fun.  He brought it up though! I always brought up phone calls! \n\n6. I asked him if he seen gameplay of the new Resident Evil game, and he said ""we watched the first movie"". And I said ""ohh yeahh"". I was surprised cause I honestly BARELY remember. 😂 I told him 7 and the new one were supposed to be pretty good, and that I'll keep up with him if he wants. He decided to watch some resident evil 7 gameplays. A couple days later, heasked me if I wanted to watch some with him and I agreed. But I assume he fell asleep midway thru the first video? 😅 I was happy he was asleep and getting peace though. \n\n7. If its late (I'm 2 hrs ahead of him) and I'm up, he'll tell me to go to sleep cause its late.\n\nAnyhow, I'm confused of why we talk to each other like this? My sister says ""he likes me, but he needs time to figure himself out cause he is a hot mess"". He definitely is. She told me to treat this like a break. But sometimes I still cry cause I really fell hard for him and I wish I'd forget. \nI know some exes decide never to speak or see each other again, but I can't do that. And I don't think he would want that too. He acts tough, but he is so sensitive. Ughh I hate myself 🙈\n\nAnyhow, what does all this mean? I feel so inclined to be like ""yooo you still like me or what?"" But I am not the kind to proclaim feelings like that 😨 Do exes ever get back together?";"Eat and stay hydrated"".";Eat and stay hydrated”.;Nezapomeň jíst a pít.“;;;FALSE

He said to me ""you hella cute, and that you need to shaddap"". \n-- I said I gtg to work now cause I'm afraid that a coworker is gonna fight me. Idk if I upset him by saying that? But it was true!  Cause he didn't text me for a whole day afterwards lmao.\n\n2. Said he was eating enchiladas. I said I like em spicy, ""but I can't handle all the fire"". To which he replied ""YoU cAn HaNdLe ThIs DiCk. They weren't that spicy"". I was like what in tarnation? 👀😂\n\n3. He'll tell me about his cats. If he slept. If he ate. I ask him sometimes too, cause he is an insomniac and bad eater. \n\n4  One time he called me hairy and I was like ""Hitting me where it hurts! (I'm middle eastern lmao 😂) Have you seen my brows though?"" He said show me. I did, with a middle finger. But that time he said ""I asked for a picture of brows, not the finger you use to touch yourself"". Not gonna lie, that pissed me off... I said  ""Why would you say that, you weirdo!? I did that cause you called me hairy?🤨😅"". I sent him a blow up of my brows from the same picture, and he said ""garbage"". And I said ""ok"". Then he didn't text me for 1.5 hours. He replied with ""WYD"". and I said ""chilling"".\n-- him going wyd is his way of saying ""I did wrong"".\n\n5. We talked on the phone for 3 hours 2 weeks ago, and we had fun.  He brought it up though! I always brought up phone calls! \n\n6. I asked him if he seen gameplay of the new Resident Evil game, and he said ""we watched the first movie"". And I said ""ohh yeahh"". I was surprised cause I honestly BARELY remember. 😂 I told him 7 and the new one were supposed to be pretty good, and that I'll keep up with him if he wants. He decided to watch some resident evil 7 gameplays. A couple days later, heasked me if I wanted to watch some with him and I agreed. But I assume he fell asleep midway thru the first video? 😅 I was happy he was asleep and getting peace though. \n\n7. If its late (I'm 2 hrs ahead of him) and I'm up, he'll tell me to go to sleep cause its late.\n\nAnyhow, I'm confused of why we talk to each other like this? My sister says ""he likes me, but he needs time to figure himself out cause he is a hot mess"". He definitely is. She told me to treat this like a break. But sometimes I still cry cause I really fell hard for him and I wish I'd forget. \nI know some exes decide never to speak or see each other again, but I can't do that. And I don't think he would want that too. He acts tough, but he is so sensitive. Ughh I hate myself 🙈\n\nAnyhow, what does all this mean? I feel so inclined to be like ""yooo you still like me or what?"" But I am not the kind to proclaim feelings like that 😨 Do exes ever get back together?";I'm trying to move on and this is now in my head.;I’m trying to move on and this is now in my head.;Snažím se posunout dál a tohle mi teď trčí v hlavě.;;;FALSE

1152;274;234;text;Gibber jabber;"Ok soooo today after I took a jog, a giant snapping turtle came to visit me. Then there was a half black half white fish, left side is white, right side is black, spotted, my mom threw away the sour cream, I had a thought "" I'm gonna make tacos, don't throw it away or this salsa"" she did that, it's not even expired, the tarrot said watch out, this is kinda nice.. by tarrot it told me my mom is not good, and maybe a few other females. Ermm... So if you also don't know me I'm a twin flame ""twin flame"" a star seed? And a sagitarius, but back to my story. So as even though I'm sad, my anxiety and depression are going away slowly, the world is changing/opening up to me, as I'm making the necessary steps for my self love or healing... Or just to ""save myself"" I know this shits confusing, my story and this world, I'm everywhere,, for the past couple of days I have been feeling guilty, for no reason, I've been thinking about my daughter and my gfs, or exe spirit wife, my lover. I know she's sad and hurting, I got tea, and thought about how my daughter died the day before/ of my birthday and my gfs birthday weekend, and if she had a natural birth she might of died (my wife), were not married I just talk like this, I wish we were married, the more I change and help myself the more my gfs/wife acts like me, I'm sure I'm just a nobody to her like I thought she was, like just a random person, a backround charecter, to much shit hit the fan while we were together, I'm so thankful she's alive, I can't speak much about my daughters death, life goes on, it may stop for you or others but for me... Idk, I need to change my mindset or this and that for my benefit and survival, I'm still “Ocean Serene” but maybe I'm ..  idk that's a tough thing to say, I never thought that my gf was just a random, I love her to death, she is my boo and will always be it. Just like I said allot of things, I'm gonna agree that if I change the world changes, the advice you get, it's allways iffy, I want to speak for everyone but at the same time I can only speak for myself, also I went to get some rum and coke, I got coke and a few other people seen it so they bought some coke.. erm, I hope my friends are ok (that's all you weirdos I'm talking about) random story I know, tbh I'm not ok, but I'm surviving like usual, actually I'm all just a bit Right and fine.

1173;277;237;text;Why is he acting this way? HELP! Losing hope;So he’s been acting weird lately. And I can just tell. I’ve know him 10 months now and I kinda have his way of texting down. I can tell when something ain’t right. I may be wrong but this ain’t it today. And the other following days. Okay so this girl is coming in the picture. He might like her and they are texting she don’t like him. He keeps trying to try with her. I guess I’m out of the picture now. We were sexting partners. But now that this bitch came in HES being dry and pushing me away. We aren’t friends we had some complications but we still chatted cuz I knew he didn’t want to let me go. But anyways today I texted him acting like eveything is normal. And I noticed that he wasn’t being his self. \n\n(1st try)\nSo I texted him saying “Bruhh how can I be louder then you and you loud 24/7!🤣” I was saying it in a joking friendly way. We had to yell our counts in practice for indoor percussion and I was louder then him. But he texted back saying “Lol🤣we get it” I didn’t really like that kind of response. Seemed rude, but it was covered up with the emojisz I already wasn’t liking this vibe. I said “Lol I was just joking man! Chill🤣🤣” and he just said “Lol”\n\n\n\n(2nd try)\nAnd then later on I texted him saying “you might wanna pull up your pants more...your whole underwear was showing..just saying” and he said “Yea lmaoo. I don’t tie my pants” finally he said two things!! He usually says one words. But he wasn’t like this two weeks ago. This was a drastic change. I said “ohhhh lmao why not😂” and he said “Cause” and I said “Hmmm”  \nOkay so I sent it at 1:46 and he read it at 2:22. I’m here waiting the whole time and he left me on read.  He don’t even wanna reply back. What’s going on. I’m starting to notice he’s acting so differently now to me. I hate it.\n\n(3rd try)\nI really needed his help and I didn’t want to text him but I had no choice. I asked him a question on counting something music related i said “Hey i don’t wanna bother you because i feel like i am but I need you help with this. What is the count for this?” and he texted back saying “123456” and I he didn’t really answer my question so I said “I should’ve been more specific. How do you count the rhythm? Are you okay?” And he said “Yea 1 3 1 5” that’s not really helping me. He’s just behind a jerk and lazy about helping me. I feel like he didn’t really...read my message he just wanted me to be like okay thanks and stop texting him.  So I said “Hmmm I don’t understand but thanks. Please tell me are you okay? Did something happen?” He said back “Wym. Your rhythm isn’t hard. And nothing happened” idk if he was busy or what. But something was off.  \nThen I said “idk I’m just asking. Lmfao it is for me. I don’t get it. It’s the counts that confuse me. Is measure 103, 1+23?  Yikes that’s probably wrong” \nThen he replied. And i left him on read. \n\n(4th try)\nThen I text him again...omg I know I’m so desperate. Jesus. I texted him about I’m gonna bring my own equipment to practice and he told me to ask the director. So I said “yeah ima do that. She said she’s fine with it so yeeee.” And he said “Bruh” another one word response...great so I said “Bruh they asked what cymbal and what size.“ and he said “Cause it’s important” idk but I wasn’t vibing his responses. He seemed off. And I said “But yeah yeah you right.” And he said “Ye well I gtg. Im doing something” and I was gonna type aight ttyl but I realized we ain’t at that level anymore. \nI didn’t like that. The vibe was going good. I didn’t have a bad vibe. When the convo started. But once he said he’s doing something my heart dropped. Like what was he doing? He’s never done this before. This was such a different person. I hate it. What can I do?\n\n\nAll these attempts I made were basically shut down. I like him but I’m not trying to flirt or do anything! I know he doenst like me like that. We talked about it. Right now I’m just chatting with him. But he doesn’t seem like he...wants to do that. \nIf he doenst want to talk to me he can just fucking tell me.;"And I said ""But yeah yeah you right.""";And I said “But yeah yeah, you’re right.”;A řekla jsem: „Ale jasně, jasně, máš pravdu.“;;;FALSE

What can I do?\n\n\nAll these attempts I made were basically shut down. I like him but I’m not trying to flirt or do anything! I know he doenst like me like that. We talked about it. Right now I’m just chatting with him. But he doesn’t seem like he...wants to do that. \nIf he doenst want to talk to me he can just fucking tell me.;The vibe was going good.;The vibe was going good.;Nálada byla příjemná.;;;FALSE
1177;277;237;text;Why is he acting this way? HELP! Losing hope;So he’s been acting weird lately. And I can just tell. I’ve know him 10 months now and I kinda have his way of texting down. I can tell when something ain’t right. I may be wrong but this ain’t it today. And the other following days. Okay so this girl is coming in the picture. He might like her and they are texting she don’t like him. He keeps trying to try with her. I guess I’m out of the picture now. We were sexting partners. But now that this bitch came in HES being dry and pushing me away. We aren’t friends we had some complications but we still chatted cuz I knew he didn’t want to let me go. But anyways today I texted him acting like eveything is normal. And I noticed that he wasn’t being his self. \n\n(1st try)\nSo I texted him saying “Bruhh how can I be louder then you and you loud 24/7!🤣” I was saying it in a joking friendly way. We had to yell our counts in practice for indoor percussion and I was louder then him. But he texted back saying “Lol🤣we get it” I didn’t really like that kind of response. Seemed rude, but it was covered up with the emojisz I already wasn’t liking this vibe. I said “Lol I was just joking man! Chill🤣🤣” and he just said “Lol”\n\n\n\n(2nd try)\nAnd then later on I texted him saying “you might wanna pull up your pants more...your whole underwear was showing..just saying” and he said “Yea lmaoo. I don’t tie my pants” finally he said two things!! He usually says one words. But he wasn’t like this two weeks ago. This was a drastic change. I said “ohhhh lmao why not😂” and he said “Cause” and I said “Hmmm”  \nOkay so I sent it at 1:46 and he read it at 2:22. I’m here waiting the whole time and he left me on read.  He don’t even wanna reply back. What’s going on. I’m starting to notice he’s acting so differently now to me. I hate it.\n\n(3rd try)\nI really needed his help and I didn’t want to text him but I had no choice. I asked him a question on counting something music related i said “Hey i don’t wanna bother you because i feel like i am but I need you help with this. What is the count for this?” and he texted back saying “123456” and I he didn’t really answer my question so I said “I should’ve been more specific. How do you count the rhythm? Are you okay?” And he said “Yea 1 3 1 5” that’s not really helping me. He’s just behind a jerk and lazy about helping me. I feel like he didn’t really...read my message he just wanted me to be like okay thanks and stop texting him.  So I said “Hmmm I don’t understand but thanks. Please tell me are you okay? Did something happen?” He said back “Wym. Your rhythm isn’t hard. And nothing happened” idk if he was busy or what. But something was off.  \nThen I said “idk I’m just asking. Lmfao it is for me. I don’t get it. It’s the counts that confuse me. Is measure 103, 1+23?  Yikes that’s probably wrong” \nThen he replied. And i left him on read. \n\n(4th try)\nThen I text him again...omg I know I’m so desperate. Jesus. I texted him about I’m gonna bring my own equipment to practice and he told me to ask the director. So I said “yeah ima do that. She said she’s fine with it so yeeee.” And he said “Bruh” another one word response...great so I said “Bruh they asked what cymbal and what size.“ and he said “Cause it’s important” idk but I wasn’t vibing his responses. He seemed off. And I said “But yeah yeah you right.” And he said “Ye well I gtg.

He don’t even wanna reply back. What’s going on. I’m starting to notice he’s acting so differently now to me. I hate it.\n\n(3rd try)\nI really needed his help and I didn’t want to text him but I had no choice. I asked him a question on counting something music related i said “Hey i don’t wanna bother you because i feel like i am but I need you help with this. What is the count for this?” and he texted back saying “123456” and I he didn’t really answer my question so I said “I should’ve been more specific. How do you count the rhythm? Are you okay?” And he said “Yea 1 3 1 5” that’s not really helping me. He’s just behind a jerk and lazy about helping me. I feel like he didn’t really...read my message he just wanted me to be like okay thanks and stop texting him.  So I said “Hmmm I don’t understand but thanks. Please tell me are you okay? Did something happen?” He said back “Wym. Your rhythm isn’t hard. And nothing happened” idk if he was busy or what. But something was off.  \nThen I said “idk I’m just asking. Lmfao it is for me. I don’t get it. It’s the counts that confuse me. Is measure 103, 1+23?  Yikes that’s probably wrong” \nThen he replied. And i left him on read. \n\n(4th try)\nThen I text him again...omg I know I’m so desperate. Jesus. I texted him about I’m gonna bring my own equipment to practice and he told me to ask the director. So I said “yeah ima do that. She said she’s fine with it so yeeee.” And he said “Bruh” another one word response...great so I said “Bruh they asked what cymbal and what size.“ and he said “Cause it’s important” idk but I wasn’t vibing his responses. He seemed off. And I said “But yeah yeah you right.” And he said “Ye well I gtg. Im doing something” and I was gonna type aight ttyl but I realized we ain’t at that level anymore. \nI didn’t like that. The vibe was going good. I didn’t have a bad vibe. When the convo started. But once he said he’s doing something my heart dropped. Like what was he doing? He’s never done this before. This was such a different person. I hate it. What can I do?\n\n\nAll these attempts I made were basically shut down. I like him but I’m not trying to flirt or do anything! I know he doenst like me like that. We talked about it. Right now I’m just chatting with him. But he doesn’t seem like he...wants to do that. \nIf he doenst want to talk to me he can just fucking tell me.;What can I do?;What can I do?;Co můžu dělat?;;;FALSE
1184;277;237;text;Why is he acting this way? HELP! Losing hope;So he’s been acting weird lately. And I can just tell. I’ve know him 10 months now and I kinda have his way of texting down. I can tell when something ain’t right. I may be wrong but this ain’t it today. And the other following days. Okay so this girl is coming in the picture. He might like her and they are texting she don’t like him. He keeps trying to try with her. I guess I’m out of the picture now. We were sexting partners. But now that this bitch came in HES being dry and pushing me away. We aren’t friends we had some complications but we still chatted cuz I knew he didn’t want to let me go. But anyways today I texted him acting like eveything is normal. And I noticed that he wasn’t being his self. \n\n(1st try)\nSo I texted him saying “Bruhh how can I be louder then you and you loud 24/7!🤣” I was saying it in a joking friendly way. We had to yell our counts in practice for indoor percussion and I was louder then him. But he texted back saying “Lol🤣we get it” I didn’t really like that kind of response. Seemed rude, but it was covered up with the emojisz I already wasn’t liking this vibe. I said “Lol I was just joking man! Chill🤣🤣” and he just said “Lol”\n\n\n\n(2nd try)\nAnd then later on I texted him saying “you might wanna pull up your pants more...your whole underwear was showing..just saying” and he said “Yea lmaoo.

What can I do?\n\n\nAll these attempts I made were basically shut down. I like him but I’m not trying to flirt or do anything! I know he doenst like me like that. We talked about it.

1190;277;237;text;Why is he acting this way? HELP! Losing hope;So he’s been acting weird lately. And I can just tell. I’ve know him 10 months now and I kinda have his way of texting down. I can tell when something ain’t right. I may be wrong but this ain’t it today. And the other following days. Okay so this girl is coming in the picture. He might like her and they are texting she don’t like him. He keeps trying to try with her. I guess I’m out of the picture now. We were sexting partners. But now that this bitch came in HES being dry and pushing me away. We aren’t friends we had some complications but we still chatted cuz I knew he didn’t want to let me go. But anyways today I texted him acting like eveything is normal. And I noticed that he wasn’t being his self. \n\n(1st try)\nSo I texted him saying “Bruhh how can I be louder then you and you loud 24/7!🤣” I was saying it in a joking friendly way. We had to yell our counts in practice for indoor percussion and I was louder then him. But he texted back saying “Lol🤣we get it” I didn’t really like that kind of response. Seemed rude, but it was covered up with the emojisz I already wasn’t liking this vibe. I said “Lol I was just joking man! Chill🤣🤣” and he just said “Lol”\n\n\n\n(2nd try)\nAnd then later on I texted him saying “you might wanna pull up your pants more...your whole underwear was showing..just saying” and he said “Yea lmaoo. I don’t tie my pants” finally he said two things!! He usually says one words. But he wasn’t like this two weeks ago. This was a drastic change. I said “ohhhh lmao why not😂” and he said “Cause” and I said “Hmmm”  \nOkay so I sent it at 1:46 and he read it at 2:22. I’m here waiting the whole time and he left me on read.  He don’t even wanna reply back. What’s going on. I’m starting to notice he’s acting so differently now to me. I hate it.\n\n(3rd try)\nI really needed his help and I didn’t want to text him but I had no choice. I asked him a question on counting something music related i said “Hey i don’t wanna bother you because i feel like i am but I need you help with this. What is the count for this?” and he texted back saying “123456” and I he didn’t really answer my question so I said “I should’ve been more specific. How do you count the rhythm? Are you okay?” And he said “Yea 1 3 1 5” that’s not really helping me. He’s just behind a jerk and lazy about helping me. I feel like he didn’t really...read my message he just wanted me to be like okay thanks and stop texting him.  So I said “Hmmm I don’t understand but thanks. Please tell me are you okay? Did something happen?” He said back “Wym. Your rhythm isn’t hard. And nothing happened” idk if he was busy or what. But something was off.  \nThen I said “idk I’m just asking. Lmfao it is for me. I don’t get it. It’s the counts that confuse me. Is measure 103, 1+23?  Yikes that’s probably wrong” \nThen he replied. And i left him on read. \n\n(4th try)\nThen I text him again...omg I know I’m so desperate. Jesus. I texted him about I’m gonna bring my own equipment to practice and he told me to ask the director. So I said “yeah ima do that. She said she’s fine with it so yeeee.” And he said “Bruh” another one word response...great so I said “Bruh they asked what cymbal and what size.“ and he said “Cause it’s important” idk but I wasn’t vibing his responses. He seemed off. And I said “But yeah yeah you right.” And he said “Ye well I gtg. Im doing something” and I was gonna type aight ttyl but I realized we ain’t at that level anymore. \nI didn’t like that. The vibe was going good. I didn’t have a bad vibe. When the convo started.

1223;285;243;text;Hunger pangs & keto;So I would usually post this on r/keto but that sub is soooooo intense about their keto. And I respect it. But like, a girl’s gotta rant.\n\nI started keto a few weeks ago. Have been doing well, and I feel like I’ve lost weight. Out of nowhere I get slammed with cravings. My body is like “bitch, CALORIES PUHLEAZE” I oh so badly want to make it to my goal weight and flock around on a beach in a bathing suit, and I also want to honor the tenacity that r/keto so proudly espouses in their no cheat days mantra. But, alas, another side of me wants to curl up in my bed with my favorite gluten free dairy free carb dense carrot cake and go to satiety land.\n\nI know the last time I did anything that remotely put me into ketosis, I would have days where my body yelped  “calories, NOW!!!” And I would gladly oblige and then return to my dietary patterns. A part of me wants to override this demand, especially taking into account the anti cheat days vibe of r/keto. But a part of me also wants to stay true to myself. I think if my body is very clearly saying “calories” I want to be true to myself & oblige. This isn’t me slowly undoing my keto efforts.

My sister (23F) is actually my half sister, but my dad took her in like his own when she was only months old. We’ve always been treated equal, and even when our parents got divorced, she would come over to his house. He actually passed away five years ago, and we got an inheritance from him and that was split equal between us. \n\nNow, my grandma (his mom) recently passed, and she left a very large inheritance. Since dad was never able to adopt sis, i am the only legal heir (my dad was my grandmas only child and i’m his only bio child). However, on all the forms we have to fill out, i have also been doing putting her contact info bc i intended to her half of everyone. \n\nNow, my aunts (gma’s sisters) are telling me I should not give her half of the money due to the way she treated gma both before and after she passed. When my gma first started getting sick, sis wasn’t the best bc she had just got a new boyfriend. She didn’t reach out a lot to my grandma, and didn’t go to see her. I would go out as much as possible, but gma was also scared of covid. The month before she passed, I told my job i couldn’t come in and would drive the hour to her house and stay with her (back & forth sometimes). I had finals going on at the same time, and had to figure out a place to live. However, i still came out right away and stayed with her up until she passed. Sis came out a couple times, but wanted to “live her life still.” \n\nOn the weekend of my grandmas funeral, sis had planned a trip with her bf and his family, and did not want to cancel whatsoever. My aunts and I did the flower arrangements, and such, and sis didn’t even offer and went on to her trip. She did leave the trip early and came to the funeral. i picked her up from the airport on the way to the funeral. Idk she rubbed my aunts the wrong way and I do think she was a bit dodgy through gma’s whole death. But i feel like it’s greedy to take majority of inheritance.

1298;299;254;text;Hey guys bard main, just join reddit after finding out there are other off metta bards! So i main him top, yes its scary but i do. So i been getting alot questions about my builds from friends and happy on lookers lately! thought i share my builds!;So, bard top can be a 50/50 bet to go into.  if you don't know who to play him against!! i can go into this later.  so first off bard top what a pick ikr.  lets drop down my main build cause its the best assasin play style i like.  * my core is static/ie/RFC. now i tried many ways and this is the best way i like to safely clear and lay out poke. now under certain occasions like vs a garen id go what many would call shot gun bard  swaping out static for runnans and if needed Rfc for pd. giving some more tank..  now as for the other two i actually leave them more optional picks in the ap department or in which case magic pen. In this section is a few situations for more sustain id pick up hextech gunblade this item is phenomenal on bard on hits are great.  if your already carrying hard id go something like lyiandries cause with the lead no one will catch you with this and the chunk is just bardo crazzzzyyyy.  yet two try gunblade and lyandries together but someday. i hardly ever get to my last item.  now if your doing horrible bad :(  ya u might wanna get some hp. if vs ad there a few great options zz rot if you just can't push out saves u alot eat poke under tower situations and the movemnt is great. if you are getting baited out you can grab one of these two deadmans ( another good on hit and roaming capabilities) or a zhonyas' if ur facing a high burst... i hardly ever run these items cause i learn your always fragile early so this is the part where you sit back tower farm but lay poke out like teemo when you can save your e for ganks or if you can bait a im stuck by river oh you come at me follow me to my tower stun pop an ignite free kill! you be surprise how many will dash into the bushes chasing you and get pulled it its almost an art to pop it just as they use a dash and boom ever time..\n\nok ok so one my hidden favs for a final item that with in conjuction with core and gunblade you can actually almost solo a baron ya a baron bard did.  drum roll oh babby its rageblade.    now i been wanting to jg bard with just those two items alone but i horrible jg.  so i get enough rage bard top till `10 mins in usually then im the kewl guy.  so some one try it out let me know how it rolls but its darn nasty top lane and even goes better with shot gun bard!  but as i said i hardly ever get that far.  \n\nnow, for the secreat to making this whole kit work the runes easy peezy pure crit runes oh ya, ikr thats messed up. but it works not only does %20 crit at the start hurt its unexpected alot.  and with just shiv alone you can now poke by hitting minions/  **blinks where did my hp go    masteries is straight forward thunderlords go assassin picks secondary tree's i have two in each ones for more sustain and ones for easy carry.  \n\non to who this works well with and who to fear.  always fear the teemo.  in this case getting gunblade first is a bit primary.  you need that sustain and don't miss your q's thats your bread and butter of not eatting posion and laying out ur q aa combo .  \n\nmalphite, this guy annoying also start ap on him.  not only does this make him build a pretty much useles mr item cause you just buil lyandries on him but he won't be expecting crit after you just build a revolver, yup just get the revoler and go into crit that item alone will help chunk.  \n\nfiora, omg i can't stand her but i have beat her this is a waiting game. you gotta play at your tower till you get two items like most bursty champs like her.  but if your timing is right and u save your q's for after her deflect (i know it starts r but im being lazy atm)  cause she lands this on ur stun ur as good as dead.  so these lanes if she backs off push out to river go chime hunting she will get more than likely annoyed that ur lvl'ing faster than her and she has no understanding why.

1337;304;258;text;An opinion from someone who hasn't played TLOU1 or 2.;"\n\nSo, I haven't played the Last of Us. Or The Last of Us 2. I never had the time as a kid, and it's something that always seems to slip my grasp. However, I have been keeping up with news relating to video games, and while I haven't played the games in this series, I can say that I can understand how plenty of you feel. I came here after reading that this sub was a cesspool of bullshit, people were just degenerates, being mean, being assholes, but after spending a bit of time in this sub, so far, I've seen that a lot of you are just genuinely angry/upset that the game you guys were waiting for just really fucking sucked. The first game prided itself on it's story telling, and the second one didn't do much of that from what I can tell. Not to mention, they half assed an attempt to humanize a character that was underdeveloped, and not only that, killed the person the player played as in the first game.\n\nThey could've done plenty to fix this.\n\nFirst off, actually develop and humanize Abby, or whatever. She killed Joel, that makes her an instant target for hate. Developing and making her relatable is key if you want at least one person out there to forgive her.\n\nApparently, there's a scene where you fight Ellie as Abby. That's already another fuck up. In a scenario like this, Ellie should be the one the player plays as, since the game is based on revenge, and Joel is already dead at this point. Making a player fight against the person their rooting for is asking for them to just make some popcorn while they feed Ellie kills and laugh as she dies. Hell, if it were me, I'd try to make them avoid contact until the end.\n\nIf you manage to write shit properly, the player should feel bad for Abby closer to the end of the game. You set up a dramatic encounter, a dramatic fight, and then Ellie gets the upper hand. Then, you give the player an option. Do you kill Abby, or spare her? That way, players can decide if they want to kill someone who now seems human, and someone they feel bad for, or shoot her ass and laugh as she dies, glad you avenged your former character.\n\nOr, ya know... Have Ellie kill Abby. Seriously, doing this would've prevented so much backlash. Easy, simple, you do the thing that the player was expected to do the player goes home somewhat fulfilled.\n\nNow, about the media.\n\nHonestly, I feel like the people who are calling other people with opinions bigots and transphobic are just simping for the game. While I will agree, some people are actually like that, and they should be called out if they're genuinely hating on a game just for sexual orientation, that isn't an excuse to be an asshole to others with genuine criticism. It really feels like this game is kinda caught in a sort of rock and a hard place. People who are super prideful of LGBTQ are defending it with their lives because 'Ooooh, representation' and companies and news organizations are capitalizing on that, shooting others down and calling them assholes for having actual, valid criticism.\n\nIn the end, this feels cheap. This game doesn't feel legit, and I didn't even play it myself. It feels like it was basically used to push an agenda of sorts, so that Playstation/Sony and Naughty Dog could be seen as these glorious heroes who have this game that stars someone from the LGBTQ community. Of course, most people wouldn't really give a shit about this, it's fanservice for the LGBTQ community, they get their representation, you guys get your game, win-win, but you guys didn't get your game. You guys got handed a game that gave you a goal, gave you your driving force, didn't really bother with the story, and then right when you were inches away from the goal you were actually invested in, it said ""Jk"" and then expected you to be okay with it, as if all that time you spent was for nothing.\n\nSo, since no one else is gonna apologize, I will.\n\nI'm genuinely sorry for the shit people have given to those who have genuinely tried to express their opinions and reasons as to why they don't enjoy the game.";You set up a dramatic encounter, a dramatic fight, and then Ellie gets the upper hand.;You set up a dramatic encounter, a dramatic fight, and then Ellie gets the upper hand.;Připravíte dramatické setkání, dramatickou bitvu a pak vás Ellie porazí.;;;TRUE

People who are super prideful of LGBTQ are defending it with their lives because 'Ooooh, representation' and companies and news organizations are capitalizing on that, shooting others down and calling them assholes for having actual, valid criticism.\n\nIn the end, this feels cheap. This game doesn't feel legit, and I didn't even play it myself. It feels like it was basically used to push an agenda of sorts, so that Playstation/Sony and Naughty Dog could be seen as these glorious heroes who have this game that stars someone from the LGBTQ community. Of course, most people wouldn't really give a shit about this, it's fanservice for the LGBTQ community, they get their representation, you guys get your game, win-win, but you guys didn't get your game. You guys got handed a game that gave you a goal, gave you your driving force, didn't really bother with the story, and then right when you were inches away from the goal you were actually invested in, it said ""Jk"" and then expected you to be okay with it, as if all that time you spent was for nothing.\n\nSo, since no one else is gonna apologize, I will.\n\nI'm genuinely sorry for the shit people have given to those who have genuinely tried to express their opinions and reasons as to why they don't enjoy the game.";An opinion from someone who hasn't played TLOU1 or 2.;An opinion from someone who hasn’t played TLOU 1 or 2.;Názor od někoho, kdo nehrál TLOU 1 nebo 2.;TLOU = The Last of Us video game;;TRUE

1421;321;270;text;Long but... PLEASE HELP - Did Hellen Keller wire my townhouse? I feel like I’m in twilight zone;Summary: I think the place I’m living is wired a little off (dangerously, maybe) I’m not certain though. My outlets are duking it out with my electronics, currently I have $6500 in fried electronics thanks to this place. Heater gets hotter than the depths of Haiti,  and I’m 99.99% positive someone is stealing my electric... or accidentally taking it. So as you could tell l, iI’m sure, I am not exactly what you’d call electrically inclined. I actually am terrified that I’m going to zap/shock myself when it’s a little dry and Im wearing some seriously fuzzy socks. I’ve asked Siri and google way to many questions about my electric issues and they are completely useless.  So I’m hoping one of you guys can help a girl out !!! so, I moved into this town house in October. It wasn’t long before I started realizing something was off about the electric. They started out semi minor and grew bigger with every new issue. ..:Let me just say that I KNOW some things might sound a little ridiculous but I swear I’m not a troll nor a paranoid schizophrenic. Upon moving in I noticed my AC didn’t work, or so I thought. After many trials and tribulations and looking like a total moron my husband tried to turn it on after 12 amH\n One night and BOOM it worked... well that was until 6 am the next morning.. wtf. I have heard of off peak but my electric company does the AC 15 min on 15 off and only during peak season during the hottest days off the year.  Anyway I got to breaker panel Box cover thingy and upon pulling it off to expose wires and what’s going where, i realized that some stuff didn’t look right to me. So, I’ve done around 3 months of my own troubleshooting and compiled massive amounts of data and through all of it I found issues that I feel should be fixed and also found other stuff that doesn’t make sense to me. I have established that there is another unit that is tied into my wiring... but not completely. I have learned that when I kill my downstairs heat switch  and my 100 gallon hot water heater switch they lose their down heat and hot water. I’m not sure if these are the only items that I control of theirs but I do know that when they are home and I have all my breakers on,\nMy meter reads Between 8-12 KWH an hour. When I turn off those 2 switches it drops down to between. .28- 2.1 When they are gone for 2or 3 days at a time and we leave switches on it stays down also.  I’m not positive but I think the owners are aware and did it to cut corners. However, always. Possibility that the man behind us did it. So I’ve had enough. I finally decided I’m done paying $300 electric bills so it can be 48 degrees in my house with no hot water. So I know I’m really opening up a can of worms with my landlord but it’s not legal and I shouldn’t have to pay someone else’s expenses nvm the $6000+ that was destroyed simply by being plugged in.... oh and the part where I barely sleep at night at fear of burning down and I won’t leave my doggy home alone either in fear a fire will catch while I’m not home.  Ok.. so one of my main questions I know I need to hire an inspector of some kind but I’m worried I’ll get one that doesn’t see. Junction box and chalks it up to me being crazy lol. So first off, can anyone tell me what two white/light tan wires that are twisted together with a bit on them labeled SS is? The black wire that is with one of the white ones is going to water heater so not sure what that means also these breakers get SO hot from time to Time you can almost smell plastic.... ok not sure exactly where i was going with some of this stuff but really would like some advice on how I should handle this. I would like to maybe take pic of it and post it so maybe someone can see if They notice anything off? Not sure if they are tandem s In place on any of mine but I’m trying to be semi pro active and get this place fined if it’s intentionally cutting corners this big risking all the lives living in this building.

1425;321;270;text;Long but... PLEASE HELP - Did Hellen Keller wire my townhouse? I feel like I’m in twilight zone;Summary: I think the place I’m living is wired a little off (dangerously, maybe) I’m not certain though. My outlets are duking it out with my electronics, currently I have $6500 in fried electronics thanks to this place. Heater gets hotter than the depths of Haiti,  and I’m 99.99% positive someone is stealing my electric... or accidentally taking it. So as you could tell l, iI’m sure, I am not exactly what you’d call electrically inclined. I actually am terrified that I’m going to zap/shock myself when it’s a little dry and Im wearing some seriously fuzzy socks. I’ve asked Siri and google way to many questions about my electric issues and they are completely useless.  So I’m hoping one of you guys can help a girl out !!! so, I moved into this town house in October. It wasn’t long before I started realizing something was off about the electric. They started out semi minor and grew bigger with every new issue. ..:Let me just say that I KNOW some things might sound a little ridiculous but I swear I’m not a troll nor a paranoid schizophrenic. Upon moving in I noticed my AC didn’t work, or so I thought. After many trials and tribulations and looking like a total moron my husband tried to turn it on after 12 amH\n One night and BOOM it worked... well that was until 6 am the next morning.. wtf. I have heard of off peak but my electric company does the AC 15 min on 15 off and only during peak season during the hottest days off the year.  Anyway I got to breaker panel Box cover thingy and upon pulling it off to expose wires and what’s going where, i realized that some stuff didn’t look right to me. So, I’ve done around 3 months of my own troubleshooting and compiled massive amounts of data and through all of it I found issues that I feel should be fixed and also found other stuff that doesn’t make sense to me. I have established that there is another unit that is tied into my wiring... but not completely. I have learned that when I kill my downstairs heat switch  and my 100 gallon hot water heater switch they lose their down heat and hot water. I’m not sure if these are the only items that I control of theirs but I do know that when they are home and I have all my breakers on,\nMy meter reads Between 8-12 KWH an hour. When I turn off those 2 switches it drops down to between. .28- 2.1 When they are gone for 2or 3 days at a time and we leave switches on it stays down also.  I’m not positive but I think the owners are aware and did it to cut corners. However, always. Possibility that the man behind us did it. So I’ve had enough. I finally decided I’m done paying $300 electric bills so it can be 48 degrees in my house with no hot water. So I know I’m really opening up a can of worms with my landlord but it’s not legal and I shouldn’t have to pay someone else’s expenses nvm the $6000+ that was destroyed simply by being plugged in.... oh and the part where I barely sleep at night at fear of burning down and I won’t leave my doggy home alone either in fear a fire will catch while I’m not home.  Ok.. so one of my main questions I know I need to hire an inspector of some kind but I’m worried I’ll get one that doesn’t see. Junction box and chalks it up to me being crazy lol. So first off, can anyone tell me what two white/light tan wires that are twisted together with a bit on them labeled SS is? The black wire that is with one of the white ones is going to water heater so not sure what that means also these breakers get SO hot from time to Time you can almost smell plastic.... ok not sure exactly where i was going with some of this stuff but really would like some advice on how I should handle this. I would like to maybe take pic of it and post it so maybe someone can see if They notice anything off? Not sure if they are tandem s In place on any of mine but I’m trying to be semi pro active and get this place fined if it’s intentionally cutting corners this big risking all the lives living in this building.

I KNOW I GOT SOMETHING GOING FOR ME BUT LIEK WHAT DO I DO PLEASE SAVE MY BUTT;"hello. I recieved the news that I know I probably wanted to hear just about a week ago. A SUPER HOT GUY AT SCHOOL THINKS IM CUTE AND IM ABOUT TO DIE. \nI was just talking and chilling with my older friend, and 2 of my other best friends. I jsut happen to mention ""Omgg Paul looked so cute today!"" Since its a literally known fact to all the girls that Paul is super attractive. I recieved an overwhelming response of yesss omg ikrrrrr ahghs. I know I probably sound like the grossest teenage girl youve heard of, but trust me Im not that wierd and caught up with boys. So anyways, then my older friend who is actually good friends with Paul proceeds to tell me the thing that made my year. SO NONCHALANTLY, AS IF ITS NO BIG DEAL, SHE THROWS THE COMMENT, ""Oh yeah. Paul thinks youre really cute"". *internal screaming* *lowkey dying sounds* *fangirling freaking out hyperventilation* *death* proceeds. If youre a girl who doesnt think youre that cute but you find out the biggest hottie thinks youre cute, youll know how much your self esteem will skyrocket. At that moment, I was not jealous of cole sprouse's future wife. jk still probably was. but jokes aside, you get how I felt. The older friend proceeded to kill me further by saying he thought I was like second cutest. I died twice. The following days I begin to notice the kid alottt more than I used to, and I felt extremely self conscious in math, ap econ, and basically every class I took with him. I hide from his view as much as possible because I want that view he has of me to stay and I dont want him to see me again and be like oh nvm nahgg she ugly af. lolol. However, I notice hes been looking at me in alot of my classes. Probably 3 days after hearing the news, I go to my Music Performance class, and I get excused to eat my lunch for special reasons alone, outside of the classroom. I sit in this chill corner near the gym class and sit and look down at my food eating. The gym class all run inside to where I am, and I look up and I see Paul. I look back down and dont think much of it other than dang he cute though. Then I see a figure slowly walkign towards my general direction, and I finally look up. THE MOMENT I LOOK UP, PAUL IS LOOKING STRAIGHT AT ME, STILL WALKING TOWARDS ME. i DONT SAY ANYTHING OR LOOK BACK DOWN BECAUSE GET THIS: HE SAYS THE FIRST THING HES EVER SAID TO ME IN THE SMEXIEST MOST HOTTEST ATTRACTIVE WAY POSSIBLE. HE SAYS ""WHATS UP"" IN THIS LOW QUIETER VOICE BUT HAS THE CUTEST BUT AT THE SAME TIME HOTTEST SMILE EVER. I BLOW UP INSIDE AND I SMILE BACK NOT HOLDING BACK MY OVERJOYED EMOTIONS. AND I SAY HI WITH THE BIGGEST SMILE I PROBABLY HAD. IM JSUT PRAYING TO GOD NOW THAT I DIDNT HAVE NASTY STUFF STUCK IN MY TEETH OR THAT MY FACE DIDNT LOOK DISGUSTING. BUT I LOOK STRAIGHT BACK DOWN AT MY FOOD AND POKERFACEDLY KEEP EATING MY FOOD. I DO THAT FOR MAYBE 3 SECONDS, THEN I LOOK BACK UP. PAUL HAS JUST STARTED WALKING AWAY, WHICH MEANS HE WAS STANDING THERE LOOKING AT ME OR DOING GODKNWOS WHAT FOR 3 SECONDS. MAYBE HE WANTED TO ACTUALLY CONVERSE WITH ME I DONT KNOW. I EAT MY FOOD FOR ABOUT ANOTHER 2 MINUTES THEN I CANT HANDLE IT NO MORE AND I WALK AS FAST AS I CAN BACK TO MY CLASSROOM HOPING HE DOESNT SEE ME. I COULDNT ENDURE THAT ATMOSPHERE. THEN I BABBLE TO MY FRIEND DURING MSUIC PERFORMANCE ABOUT MY INSANE EXPERIENCE AND THEN BAD NEWS.\nshe tells me theres a high chance hes a player, she tells me theres alot of bad rumours that he drinks and smokes, two things im not that into. I dont like sketchy guys, and I definitely dont have legit feelings for this guy, i just kind of dont know my feelings about whether i want to know him better and give him a chance despite his intimidating looks and rumours, but i know im interested. OH. i also slapped his butt pretty hard on accident about 3 classes before he said hi to me. I told that older friend about the awkward butt thing and the whatsup thing and his cute smile thats worth dying for, and she jsut  said he was proabbly turned on by my slap which makes me feel uncomfortable, considering another dude who knows PAUL told me to not ""Worry about the butt slap too much. trust me he liked it."" ..... well...  \nAlso, my older friend told me hes nice and a super sweet guy even though he looks intimidating. \nWhat should I dooo?? \nTell me:\n1.What I should do, should I try to get to know him or avoid him??\n2.

So anyways, then my older friend who is actually good friends with Paul proceeds to tell me the thing that made my year. SO NONCHALANTLY, AS IF ITS NO BIG DEAL, SHE THROWS THE COMMENT, ""Oh yeah. Paul thinks youre really cute"". *internal screaming* *lowkey dying sounds* *fangirling freaking out hyperventilation* *death* proceeds. If youre a girl who doesnt think youre that cute but you find out the biggest hottie thinks youre cute, youll know how much your self esteem will skyrocket. At that moment, I was not jealous of cole sprouse's future wife. jk still probably was. but jokes aside, you get how I felt. The older friend proceeded to kill me further by saying he thought I was like second cutest. I died twice. The following days I begin to notice the kid alottt more than I used to, and I felt extremely self conscious in math, ap econ, and basically every class I took with him. I hide from his view as much as possible because I want that view he has of me to stay and I dont want him to see me again and be like oh nvm nahgg she ugly af. lolol. However, I notice hes been looking at me in alot of my classes. Probably 3 days after hearing the news, I go to my Music Performance class, and I get excused to eat my lunch for special reasons alone, outside of the classroom. I sit in this chill corner near the gym class and sit and look down at my food eating. The gym class all run inside to where I am, and I look up and I see Paul. I look back down and dont think much of it other than dang he cute though. Then I see a figure slowly walkign towards my general direction, and I finally look up. THE MOMENT I LOOK UP, PAUL IS LOOKING STRAIGHT AT ME, STILL WALKING TOWARDS ME. i DONT SAY ANYTHING OR LOOK BACK DOWN BECAUSE GET THIS: HE SAYS THE FIRST THING HES EVER SAID TO ME IN THE SMEXIEST MOST HOTTEST ATTRACTIVE WAY POSSIBLE. HE SAYS ""WHATS UP"" IN THIS LOW QUIETER VOICE BUT HAS THE CUTEST BUT AT THE SAME TIME HOTTEST SMILE EVER. I BLOW UP INSIDE AND I SMILE BACK NOT HOLDING BACK MY OVERJOYED EMOTIONS.

The older friend proceeded to kill me further by saying he thought I was like second cutest. I died twice. The following days I begin to notice the kid alottt more than I used to, and I felt extremely self conscious in math, ap econ, and basically every class I took with him. I hide from his view as much as possible because I want that view he has of me to stay and I dont want him to see me again and be like oh nvm nahgg she ugly af. lolol. However, I notice hes been looking at me in alot of my classes. Probably 3 days after hearing the news, I go to my Music Performance class, and I get excused to eat my lunch for special reasons alone, outside of the classroom. I sit in this chill corner near the gym class and sit and look down at my food eating. The gym class all run inside to where I am, and I look up and I see Paul. I look back down and dont think much of it other than dang he cute though. Then I see a figure slowly walkign towards my general direction, and I finally look up. THE MOMENT I LOOK UP, PAUL IS LOOKING STRAIGHT AT ME, STILL WALKING TOWARDS ME. i DONT SAY ANYTHING OR LOOK BACK DOWN BECAUSE GET THIS: HE SAYS THE FIRST THING HES EVER SAID TO ME IN THE SMEXIEST MOST HOTTEST ATTRACTIVE WAY POSSIBLE. HE SAYS ""WHATS UP"" IN THIS LOW QUIETER VOICE BUT HAS THE CUTEST BUT AT THE SAME TIME HOTTEST SMILE EVER. I BLOW UP INSIDE AND I SMILE BACK NOT HOLDING BACK MY OVERJOYED EMOTIONS. AND I SAY HI WITH THE BIGGEST SMILE I PROBABLY HAD. IM JSUT PRAYING TO GOD NOW THAT I DIDNT HAVE NASTY STUFF STUCK IN MY TEETH OR THAT MY FACE DIDNT LOOK DISGUSTING. BUT I LOOK STRAIGHT BACK DOWN AT MY FOOD AND POKERFACEDLY KEEP EATING MY FOOD. I DO THAT FOR MAYBE 3 SECONDS, THEN I LOOK BACK UP. PAUL HAS JUST STARTED WALKING AWAY, WHICH MEANS HE WAS STANDING THERE LOOKING AT ME OR DOING GODKNWOS WHAT FOR 3 SECONDS. MAYBE HE WANTED TO ACTUALLY CONVERSE WITH ME I DONT KNOW. I EAT MY FOOD FOR ABOUT ANOTHER 2 MINUTES THEN I CANT HANDLE IT NO MORE AND I WALK AS FAST AS I CAN BACK TO MY CLASSROOM HOPING HE DOESNT SEE ME. I COULDNT ENDURE THAT ATMOSPHERE. THEN I BABBLE TO MY FRIEND DURING MSUIC PERFORMANCE ABOUT MY INSANE EXPERIENCE AND THEN BAD NEWS.\nshe tells me theres a high chance hes a player, she tells me theres alot of bad rumours that he drinks and smokes, two things im not that into. I dont like sketchy guys, and I definitely dont have legit feelings for this guy, i just kind of dont know my feelings about whether i want to know him better and give him a chance despite his intimidating looks and rumours, but i know im interested. OH. i also slapped his butt pretty hard on accident about 3 classes before he said hi to me. I told that older friend about the awkward butt thing and the whatsup thing and his cute smile thats worth dying for, and she jsut  said he was proabbly turned on by my slap which makes me feel uncomfortable, considering another dude who knows PAUL told me to not ""Worry about the butt slap too much. trust me he liked it."" ..... well...  \nAlso, my older friend told me hes nice and a super sweet guy even though he looks intimidating. \nWhat should I dooo?? \nTell me:\n1.What I should do, should I try to get to know him or avoid him??\n2.

1464;328;276;text;This feels like the most compelling year to trade back in recent memory;IK its not exactly the most popular idea in the world but analytics really say trade back all the time. Even though that's the case when draft time comes around I usually feel like everyone else and really just want to get that one guy (Brian Burns, Ridley or Moore last year etc.). This probably comes from the false notion that we judge a players value where they are mocked and there are big perceived differences of those players the further you go down but in reality the difference ends up being very small, a ton of busts gems so logically having 2 picks vs 1 dramatically increases your chances of having success. \n\nThat being said, this year feels a lot different and I do not have to convince myself its the right move, it really just feels right this year for several reasons.\n\n1. The team is not really just plug this hole in and we will be pretty good. There are several issues across the board. We have very few players signed right now particularly on defense and do not have a ton of money to fill those holes in FA. It would be more ideal than it has in the past to find several impact starters rather than 1 great player (although as mentioned picking later would not significantly diminish the chance of getting a star player). DT we may only have 1 player in KK as I assume we cut Poe, we will definitely sign more but can not put a ton of our money there. DT is probably the most important position to have depth at as backups are usually going to take up to 30ish % of snaps. Depending on the system we use we may need 4-6 guys there and probably 4-5 will play meaningful snaps and that's with no injuries.  Take that with needs currently elsewhere, we only have Jackson under contract at CB currently, no viable FS atm, a starting worthy edge player opposite of Burns imo atm, and many people unsatisfied with the current starting line. We also have just about no backups you do not think that much about undercontract and we have to fill out those spots. FA will take care of some of it but with our money a lot of needs will be there come draft day.\n\n\n\n2. We have several stars already, we really need the supporting pieces. I'm optimistic on Cam and he fully qualifies, we have the best RB in the league, the best LB in the league, KK is a top 10 DT imo, Turner is a fringe pro bowler every year. I think we have a stellar emerging duo at WR, Moton is an emerging star at RT (if you need the proof hes ranked 4th in pass block efficiency and if you pay attention he passes that eye test), I believe in Donte Jacksons potential and smarter football minds than mine like  him a lot, Shaq is a very high quality second linebacker, Burns looks like a future stud, Little may be pretty good imo if healthy.  With all of those players on a team you would think we would be pretty damn good. The problem is everywhere else is just lacking, we need to fill out a lot of spots to support a very top heavy roster. Trading back would increase the chances of that.\n\n3. I am just not in love with any prospect at pick 6 that fits need, talent, and positional value. I think DT is the biggest and that's rarely a top 10 pick. Derrick Brown is the guy mocked in our area but the more reading I have done he is just not the type of prospect that warrants a top 10 pick at DT. He may slip later but if not Kinlaw right now is a guy that is going in the mid to late first. If we traded back and got him are we really that sure Brown will be the better player? Will he be so much beter that hes worth more than Kinlaw and the player(s) that we pick from the extra picks we get? OT could be there like Thomas but Im just not convinced any guy we take will be better than Little entering his 2nd year. He has health concerns atm but we also have Daley entering his 2nd year and is a decent safety net. Interior oline I think is a major problem but there is no Nelson like prospects that are going in the top 10. Edge might be a need depending on FA and the Iowa guy (can not spell his name) is good but that's still a bit of a reach. If we do not resign Bradberry and Okudah is there that really the only situation I absolutely stay put.\n\n\n\n4. We are terribly missing depth at just about every position. Even trading back just a few spots for an extra mid late rounder would be beneficial. We need a bunch of guys that can just make the roster and make smaller contributions. I do not think trading back a few spots atm really changes what is available that we want and an extra pick certainly does not hurt. Think a late pick like Miller or Haynes at other positions like a 3rd LB, a developmental OL, a DT that could play 10-15 snaps a game, maybe a nickel CB, a 3rd WR replacement etc.;Will he be so much beter that hes worth more than Kinlaw and the player(s) that we pick from the extra picks we get?;Will he be so much better that he’s worth more than Kinlaw and the player(s) that we pick from the extra picks we get?;Bude o tolik lepší, že má větší hodnotu než Kinlaw a hráči, které si vybereme z dostupných výběrů navíc?;;;TRUE

He may slip later but if not Kinlaw right now is a guy that is going in the mid to late first. If we traded back and got him are we really that sure Brown will be the better player? Will he be so much beter that hes worth more than Kinlaw and the player(s) that we pick from the extra picks we get? OT could be there like Thomas but Im just not convinced any guy we take will be better than Little entering his 2nd year. He has health concerns atm but we also have Daley entering his 2nd year and is a decent safety net. Interior oline I think is a major problem but there is no Nelson like prospects that are going in the top 10. Edge might be a need depending on FA and the Iowa guy (can not spell his name) is good but that's still a bit of a reach. If we do not resign Bradberry and Okudah is there that really the only situation I absolutely stay put.\n\n\n\n4. We are terribly missing depth at just about every position. Even trading back just a few spots for an extra mid late rounder would be beneficial. We need a bunch of guys that can just make the roster and make smaller contributions. I do not think trading back a few spots atm really changes what is available that we want and an extra pick certainly does not hurt. Think a late pick like Miller or Haynes at other positions like a 3rd LB, a developmental OL, a DT that could play 10-15 snaps a game, maybe a nickel CB, a 3rd WR replacement etc.;Edge might be a need depending on FA and the Iowa guy (can not spell his name) is good but that's still a bit of a reach.;Edge might be a need depending on FA, and the Iowa guy (I cannot spell his name) is good, but that’s still a bit of a reach.;V závislosti na FA budeme možná potřebovat kraje a ten kluk z Iowy (nedokážu napsat jeho jméno) je dobrý, ale je to je pořád možná trochu přehnané.;;;TRUE
1469;328;276;text;This feels like the most compelling year to trade back in recent memory;IK its not exactly the most popular idea in the world but analytics really say trade back all the time. Even though that's the case when draft time comes around I usually feel like everyone else and really just want to get that one guy (Brian Burns, Ridley or Moore last year etc.). This probably comes from the false notion that we judge a players value where they are mocked and there are big perceived differences of those players the further you go down but in reality the difference ends up being very small, a ton of busts gems so logically having 2 picks vs 1 dramatically increases your chances of having success. \n\nThat being said, this year feels a lot different and I do not have to convince myself its the right move, it really just feels right this year for several reasons.\n\n1. The team is not really just plug this hole in and we will be pretty good. There are several issues across the board. We have very few players signed right now particularly on defense and do not have a ton of money to fill those holes in FA. It would be more ideal than it has in the past to find several impact starters rather than 1 great player (although as mentioned picking later would not significantly diminish the chance of getting a star player). DT we may only have 1 player in KK as I assume we cut Poe, we will definitely sign more but can not put a ton of our money there. DT is probably the most important position to have depth at as backups are usually going to take up to 30ish % of snaps. Depending on the system we use we may need 4-6 guys there and probably 4-5 will play meaningful snaps and that's with no injuries.  Take that with needs currently elsewhere, we only have Jackson under contract at CB currently, no viable FS atm, a starting worthy edge player opposite of Burns imo atm, and many people unsatisfied with the current starting line. We also have just about no backups you do not think that much about undercontract and we have to fill out those spots. FA will take care of some of it but with our money a lot of needs will be there come draft day.\n\n\n\n2. We have several stars already, we really need the supporting pieces. I'm optimistic on Cam and he fully qualifies, we have the best RB in the league, the best LB in the league, KK is a top 10 DT imo, Turner is a fringe pro bowler every year. I think we have a stellar emerging duo at WR, Moton is an emerging star at RT (if you need the proof hes ranked 4th in pass block efficiency and if you pay attention he passes that eye test), I believe in Donte Jacksons potential and smarter football minds than mine like  him a lot, Shaq is a very high quality second linebacker, Burns looks like a future stud, Little may be pretty good imo if healthy.  With all of those players on a team you would think we would be pretty damn good. The problem is everywhere else is just lacking, we need to fill out a lot of spots to support a very top heavy roster. Trading back would increase the chances of that.\n\n3. I am just not in love with any prospect at pick 6 that fits need, talent, and positional value. I think DT is the biggest and that's rarely a top 10 pick. Derrick Brown is the guy mocked in our area but the more reading I have done he is just not the type of prospect that warrants a top 10 pick at DT.

1481;332;279;title;[HELP] My puppy has suddenly refuaed to poop anywhere except inside;So this all started about 2-3 weeks ago. My puppy (6 1/2mo pit/boxer mix) has solely wanted to poop inside only. And it's always in the same spot, by the backdoor where she normally goes to alert that she needs to use the bathroom, or in her crate sometimes. I take her out and she pees just fine but then whines because she needs to poop the whole time we're outside. I live in a quadraplex with a shared strip of backyard space but this hasn't ever been a problem in the 4 months that I've had her. And whenever she does poop inside it's  watery like she'd been holding it for quite a while. Taking her onn walks doesn't help either. I'm stuck and I have no clue what to do. Has anyone else had this issue? And if so, what's the best way to solve it? Thank you in advance for any advice.;[HELP] My puppy has suddenly refuaed to poop anywhere except inside;[HELP] My puppy has suddenly refused to poop anywhere except inside.;[POMOC] Moje štěně najednou přestalo kadit jinde než uvnitř.;;;FALSE

Chicken bowls, Poke Bowls, or anything with a simple protein and carb. I would guess i'm eating about 3000 calories a day.\n\n\n\n**Routine:**\n\n\n\nI go to the gym 5-6x a week.

1537;342;287;title;WIBTA for keeping our house in the divorce so I can rent out the other rooms?;Basically the title, but here's some context.\n\nMy(29m) wife(32f) of 5 years wants a divorce. The relevant reason is my unhealthy spending habits, which I am getting help for, but she can't wait for that or trust that it will work(I understand and accept this). We have two daughters,(2 and 2mo), who will likely be living primarily with her. \n\nMy STBXW wants to sell the house and split whatever comes from it. I want to offer to buy her out of what little equity we have(refinanced in June, had to partially pay out of pocket because our previous equity couldn't cover the refinance costs),and then live in one room and rent out the other 3 so that I can afford to live while paying the spousal and child support.\n\nWhat might make me TA, is that my STBXW and kids will probably end up living in a trailer on her parents property because the cost of living here is very high. However, even the child and spousal support wouldn't cover the mortgage for her to keep the house, and I'm obviously going to have to make sure she gets fair value out of our shared assets. \n\nI think that's about it. So, WIBTA?;WIBTA for keeping our house in the divorce so I can rent out the other rooms?;Would I be the asshole for keeping our house in the divorce so I can rent out the other rooms?;Byl bych za debila, kdybych si po rozvodu nechal náš dům, abych mohl pronajímat ostatní pokoje?;;Czech: Masculine form;FALSE

I was waking her to feed every 3 hours during the day. At 6 weeks, I was advised to follow baby’s cues and let her sleep and not wake her because sleep begets sleep. Then peak crying happened and she would not sleep unless being held so to prioritize her sleep knowing its importance to her developing, and I held her most of the time so she can achieve deep sleep for a long period of time.\n\nNow, I’ve returned her to her bassinet but she is not sleeping in it like before... we hold her to sleep (most of the time with a pacifier but sometimes without one) and place her in her bassinet. Putting her down Drowsy does not work for her (results in her waking up and crying every time). Once that pacifier is out she’ll cry for it. Sometimes she’ll sleep for a bit longer before crying, but it is bound to happen.. I’ve used TCB’s SITBACK, the waiting and touching to no avail until the pacifier is replaced, which settles her only until the next hour. Last night she went 6 hours of “sleep” in her bassinet, but I was replacing the pacifier every hour.\n\nShe is swaddled and a white noise machine and black out blinds are used for every sleep/nap, unless she is in the car seat or I am wearing her.\n\nAlso, I dont know if it’s the thrush or not, but she also cries and refuses to feed if she’s not hungry so I cannot “tank her up”. \n\nFor the record, if the pacifier falls out while she is in the car seat, she can still sleep for an extended period of time (one or two sleep cycles). \n\nWhat am I doing wrong :(?

1714;394;334;title;Dramatic death scenes and bringing the characters back with a gag do NOT go hand in hand.;"SPOILERS.\n\nI've got a few gripes with TF2 comics and #6 specifically, but this is something that annoys me the most about the last one.\n\nSniper's resurrection in #5 worked because it was shown as something that took effort, as a one-time occurrence made possible by Medic's mad genius.\n\nIn #6, seven people die, and all seven get brought back to life, with varying degrees of bullshit.\n\nAt the beginning of the story, Medic brings back five people by... pouring dirty blood into them. Boom, that's it, that dramatic cliffhanger of Issue #5 is negated by medical malpractice that works because... whatever. Maybe it's Medic's deal with the devil.\n\nSpeaking of that, Medic's resurrection is borderline bullshit too. OH HAI, YOU GOT MY SOUL, BUT I HAVE EIGHT MORE, CIAO. Yes, I know he's the resident Mad Doktor, but when the words ""I surgically added eight souls [to my body]"" are used with a relatively straight face, I think it's safe to call BS.\n \nAnd then we get the Scout. \n\n> God: You got laid?\n\n> Scout: Nope.\n\n> God: Me dammit, you were a gift to humanity! Get back there and fuck all the chicks!\n\nYou what m8?\n\nAnd now here's a thing: I wouldn't care about it enough to write a rant on /r/tf2, but all the deaths I mentioned above were played for drama. Sniper getting shot? Dramatic, shows that TFC mercs don't have time for bullshit. Ditto for the bloodsucking robots. Medic's death? Makes Heavy go ballistic. Scout's death? Spy disguises himself as Tom Jones to give him a nice send-off, AND we got the confirmation of the theory about Spy being his father. If you then bring the character back to life with a bloody joke bordering on Deux Ex Machina, you kiiiinda turned around and tossed that drama into the river in cement shoes.\n\nThere, I said it.

1744;404;343;text;Guide:How to meet women;So yeah, since i started to go on reddit i have seen people cry about not being able to get a girlfriend because they are ugly/shy/too big/too small or whatever. I know how you feel. I am a skinny, black, not so good looking man. I was just like you, all my friends had girlfriends or friends with benefits, and when i asked them „how they did it“, nobody had an answer. But after a lot of try and error, things changed form me. Thats why i decided to make a simple, maybe unethical guide on how to meet women for people with the same problems as i had them, so you dont have to take the long journey of rejections as i have. If i can even help out 1 person with it, then it will be worth it. Brace yourself this is gonna be a long post. (English is my second language, sorry)\nAlso: These is the way on how I meet women. If someone else got a better way then feel free, im pretty sure this is not the only and right way to the goal.\n \nBefore i begin i wanted to say my No.1 rule that i learned:\nWomen are people!\nWomen just like men also have their insecurities, their preferences, their hobbys, their own life. Treat them with respect. They are not a sex-object or an untouchable god in human form. Women are humans, like you and me.\n \nLets start:\n„I am too ugly“ \nYou might think that you are the problem. That you are just dont look good enough for anyone to be attracted to you. I know these are tough words, but unless you are actually physically or mentally disabled (and i dont mean a bit of adhd or autism, i mean the real „its physically impossible to interact with humans“ stuff) its simply not true. If you are in the challenged 1-2% bracket, then this guide can still work for you, but lets be real here, it is going to be a lot harder for you than for the rest. The other 98% of the people look pretty decent if the put in a little bit of work: like brush your teeth, dress nice, comb your hair, shave, …, yeah that pretty much it. And i  know are thinking: UUUHH i am fat, even if i do all these things i am still not good looking. And guess what: Obviously not EVERY girl is going to fall in love with you the second you shave your beard, but like rule no.1 says, every women has her own preference. Some like big/fat dudes, some skinny dudes, some muscular dudes. There will be women who like you/your body type and it is possible that the number is much higher than you think. \n \n„Where can i meet new women?“\n \nFirst of all: you need talk. I know many of you are introverted basement kids. I was too. Gaming / watching netflix is nice, but it holds you back SOOO much. It takes away too much of your time. You gotta force yourself out there, or it is not going to happen. Dont forget, you are not only looking for a girl, but also for a friend. Thats why its called girlfriend. My bet is, that most of the friends you made are from school or work, or friends of friends who you went to school or work with. In school and at work, you are forced to talk to people, it is impossible not to. In you free time nobody will order you to meet someone new. You gotta take it into your own hands and search for them yourself. Nobody is gonna come to you.\nOne rule of socializing that i follow: Never say no if you are invited to something. Always go if it is possible. Rough day at work and tired? You still go. You are lazy and just want to game all night? You still go. You dont want to talk to strangers? You still go. Even if you dont meet your perfect women there, you still might get a nice story to tell at parties to appear interesting.\n My advice to find friends? There are plenty of „find a friend apps“. i know it sounds cringe, but it worked well for me. If you dont know any of those apps: tinder also works not only as a dating-site, but also for a platform to meet new people. Not only women. most men on these sites who are looking for other men are not gay, they are just looking for friends to drink a beer or do some sport together. Get yourself comfortable with talking to strangers, you will see that it is easier than you think.  \nAnd again i know what you think: „I tRiEd TiNdEr aNd I gEt nO mAtcHes (with women)“. Yeah obviously, you are not that good looking, you will only meet men. Like i said, only to socialize.\n„where can i meet new women then?“\nIf you ask this question on reddit, most answers are gonna be like this: „Just find a hobby! Go cooking or something and meet women there. They even got the same interests!“. What bullshit… the moment i read stuff like this, i always imagine a dude signing up for a cooking class, just to find out that its full of horny dudes. What if you like playing football and gaming? i doubt that you can reliably meet new women there. And just trying out new stuff day and night? It will hurt your wallet and sleeping rythm.\nAnother funny answer: „just go to a bar!“ – Yeah idk how it is with your friends, but when i am in a bar with my gang, we just sit and talk by ourselves. No new interactions whatsoever. Or have you ever seen a person just walking up to a group of girls like Barney Stinson? \n \nLittle sidenote: You want to meet people at places where they want to meet new people too. Dont be that weird dude who chats up women at the supermarket or at the sidewalk.\n \nSo you are gonna be looking for a place where you actively meet new people, and speak to them.\nOne place, where this happens are for example birthday parties/weddings/etc.  But my go-to tip:\n \nClubbing & chatting people up\nYeah the beautiful world of clubbing. At no place it is easier to get laid then there. I know that dancing could be a problem for you all. At my first time at a club, i was just standing there like a tree. But the more often you go, the easier it will get. After 2-3 times it will start to be fun. Go to clubs with music you enjoy, and if you dont know what you like, again: try and error. You will find your style. Also: nobody cares about you dancing. Most wont notice if you dance too hard/too bad. Just enjoy your time.\nAgain, i know what you think: „There are so many good looking dudes in the club. How can i ever keep up with them. Why should any women choose me over the dude with the sixpack?“\nMy answer is simple: Have you seen the men nowadays? No. Fking. Competition.  Most men this day are thirsty af. The era of gentlemen is over. They are either idiots, look like a half assed rapper or are complete assholes. Often times all of that. In their primitive brains they grab and grunt at everything with 2 legs. And i mean that literally. \nBUT – thats good for you. If you just behave like a decent human being, then you are already better than 80% of the other dudes.\n \nOk now we get to the meeting part: And it is actually really simple. You just pick a girl you like and go talk to her. Worst case scenario? – she rejects you and you leave. Then try again (with a different girl.) Dont wait for her to give you a signal ( like smiling at you or a wink) cause lets be real, she most likely wont notice you until you talk to her. Also, try to do it alone. I know it is really tempting to let your friends „wingman“ you, but you wont be taken seriously by any women if you let your friends joke you into a relationship (Hey have you met… doesnt work in real life, i tried it out:D).\nThe best places to chat a girl up in the club are:\n1.      At the bar \nJust walk up to someone, introduce yourself, say that you think she is pretty and that you want to buy her a drink (i know, all these gender-knights are gonna be furious.) Easy as that, gets the conversation going. You can ask her what drinks she likes/how old she is (maybe dont forget about that one lol)/ her name / where she works / why she is in the city/ where and who she is here/etc. These are some convo-starters just on the top of my hat. There you can see if she likes you back or not. Women are not stupid, they know what you are up to. Most oft he time if she declines your offer she doesnt like you. If she accepts she does. Suprisingly it is rather rare that i had a girl just abusing me for free drinks, so i wouldnt worry too much about that. Most women dont whore themselves out for a shot.\n \n2.      At the smoking area (only for (party) smokers)\nSame scenario. You pick a girl you like, go up to her and ask her for a lighter or something. Then start talking to her. If she doesnt really respond/walks away straight after smoking she most likely is not interested. If she stays and keeps talking? Nice. \n \nOk, lets assume everything went well and you are now talking/ dancing for a while. What do you do next? First of all you gotta find out if she is single or not. She will probably just tell you that. If not, her clothes are a also a good indicator on the relationship status. If you really cant tell, then just ask her. Is she single and interested in you? Nice. Now to the hard part of this guide.\nSo like i said, Women are not stupid, they know what you are up to. If you are talking to her for that long, she might be interested in more. You want to kiss her now, get the ball into the goal. You want to wait for the right moment, but dont overestimate it. This isnt a movie. There are no fireworks/rain/romantic music in the background. The world wont stand still for you. Just do it. All or nothing. Again, worst case, you get rejected, better luck next time. Dont think about what happens if it doesnt work, think about what happens if it works. \nNow you kiss her and you party the rest of the night? Nice.\n \nIf you missed the right moment, it is fine too. Since you are talking to each other she is likely waiting for you to make a move. But i know it can be hard to notice it sometimes, especially if you are new in the dating world. What you can also do is just straight up ask her if you can kiss her. But there is a chance, that it will be really akward (cause lets be real. Who does that?). \n \nNow the day is coming to an end, you are standing outside/ready to go/saying goodbye there are several options for you:\n1.      You take her home with you/go home with her\nYou can straight up ask her to go home with you. Bold move, i wouldnt recommend it. You are both under the influence, bad idea. Also if she says no and is offended by it, it can crush your previous work. But i know how the horny mind can be sometimes. If she says yes, the rest pretty much goes by itself. You go to your/her place, and the rest is for your biology teacher to explain.\n2.      You go home without her\n \nOk, you will want exchange contact info (Preferably with a number, insta/snap works as well.). Whats really important at this step, is that you give your number to her. You dont ask for her number. Thats because then SHE can decide if she wants to see you again/keep in touch with you. Only she should have your contact info, you should have no way of contacting her. If she writes you a message in the next morning, you know that she wants to see you again. If not, she just had a nice evening and wants to keep it that way. That way you can be sure too if she wants you or not. \n \nDating\nI dont want to go too in depth about dating, just some general advice\n \n-         While texting each other, just write back, dont play games (like waiting extra long to reply to seem busy). Nobody likes people who plays games\n-         Talk about what you are looking for (ONS/F+/relationship/something weird)\n-         I know i dont have to say it but: no dick pics\n-         Dont be afraid to ask for a date/ dont wait too long for it, people lose interest very fast\n-         If you got a date, think about a good place to go where you can talk. (movie theatres for example are a really bad idea, cause you just sit next to each other. Taking a walk together sucks too, cause it is boring af) ( nice ideas are for example: cooking together / going to a bar/ swimming)\n-         If you talk pick suitable themes: pls dont be that weird and boring dude who talks about gaming/anime/school/work, unless she brings it up. \n-         Suitable themes are: if you met before, last night out, funny storys, vacations you took/want to take, etc.. basically everything that doesnt make you sound like a 14 yo. \n-         And most important of all: Respect her. No is no. If she doesnt want to continue, accept it. Dont start simping or stalking or anything. There are millions of women out there, someone will like you.\n \nOk, that was all i wanted to say, maybe it helped you a bit. In the end it all comes down to your own self-esteem. Dont be afraid to socialize. Find friends first, then the love life will follow by itself. Dont be afraid to talk to Women. They are just people.\n \nIf you have questions or didnt understand anything, just ask. I will happily answer (if it is not too personal cause this is still reddit.)\n \n;My answer is simple: Have you seen the men nowadays?;My answer is simple: Have you seen the men nowadays?;Mám jednoduchou odpověď: Viděli jste dnešní chlapy?;;;FALSE
1745;404;343;text;Guide:How to meet women;So yeah, since i started to go on reddit i have seen people cry about not being able to get a girlfriend because they are ugly/shy/too big/too small or whatever. I know how you feel. I am a skinny, black, not so good looking man. I was just like you, all my friends had girlfriends or friends with benefits, and when i asked them „how they did it“, nobody had an answer. But after a lot of try and error, things changed form me. Thats why i decided to make a simple, maybe unethical guide on how to meet women for people with the same problems as i had them, so you dont have to take the long journey of rejections as i have. If i can even help out 1 person with it, then it will be worth it. Brace yourself this is gonna be a long post. (English is my second language, sorry)\nAlso: These is the way on how I meet women. If someone else got a better way then feel free, im pretty sure this is not the only and right way to the goal.\n \nBefore i begin i wanted to say my No.1 rule that i learned:\nWomen are people!\nWomen just like men also have their insecurities, their preferences, their hobbys, their own life. Treat them with respect. They are not a sex-object or an untouchable god in human form. Women are humans, like you and me.\n \nLets start:\n„I am too ugly“ \nYou might think that you are the problem. That you are just dont look good enough for anyone to be attracted to you. I know these are tough words, but unless you are actually physically or mentally disabled (and i dont mean a bit of adhd or autism, i mean the real „its physically impossible to interact with humans“ stuff) its simply not true. If you are in the challenged 1-2% bracket, then this guide can still work for you, but lets be real here, it is going to be a lot harder for you than for the rest. The other 98% of the people look pretty decent if the put in a little bit of work: like brush your teeth, dress nice, comb your hair, shave, …, yeah that pretty much it. And i  know are thinking: UUUHH i am fat, even if i do all these things i am still not good looking. And guess what: Obviously not EVERY girl is going to fall in love with you the second you shave your beard, but like rule no.1 says, every women has her own preference. Some like big/fat dudes, some skinny dudes, some muscular dudes. There will be women who like you/your body type and it is possible that the number is much higher than you think. \n \n„Where can i meet new women?“\n \nFirst of all: you need talk. I know many of you are introverted basement kids. I was too. Gaming / watching netflix is nice, but it holds you back SOOO much. It takes away too much of your time. You gotta force yourself out there, or it is not going to happen. Dont forget, you are not only looking for a girl, but also for a friend. Thats why its called girlfriend. My bet is, that most of the friends you made are from school or work, or friends of friends who you went to school or work with. In school and at work, you are forced to talk to people, it is impossible not to. In you free time nobody will order you to meet someone new. You gotta take it into your own hands and search for them yourself. Nobody is gonna come to you.\nOne rule of socializing that i follow: Never say no if you are invited to something. Always go if it is possible. Rough day at work and tired? You still go. You are lazy and just want to game all night? You still go. You dont want to talk to strangers? You still go. Even if you dont meet your perfect women there, you still might get a nice story to tell at parties to appear interesting.\n My advice to find friends? There are plenty of „find a friend apps“. i know it sounds cringe, but it worked well for me. If you dont know any of those apps: tinder also works not only as a dating-site, but also for a platform to meet new people. Not only women. most men on these sites who are looking for other men are not gay, they are just looking for friends to drink a beer or do some sport together. Get yourself comfortable with talking to strangers, you will see that it is easier than you think.  \nAnd again i know what you think: „I tRiEd TiNdEr aNd I gEt nO mAtcHes (with women)“. Yeah obviously, you are not that good looking, you will only meet men. Like i said, only to socialize.\n„where can i meet new women then?“\nIf you ask this question on reddit, most answers are gonna be like this: „Just find a hobby! Go cooking or something and meet women there. They even got the same interests!“. What bullshit… the moment i read stuff like this, i always imagine a dude signing up for a cooking class, just to find out that its full of horny dudes. What if you like playing football and gaming? i doubt that you can reliably meet new women there. And just trying out new stuff day and night? It will hurt your wallet and sleeping rythm.\nAnother funny answer: „just go to a bar!“ – Yeah idk how it is with your friends, but when i am in a bar with my gang, we just sit and talk by ourselves. No new interactions whatsoever. Or have you ever seen a person just walking up to a group of girls like Barney Stinson? \n \nLittle sidenote: You want to meet people at places where they want to meet new people too. Dont be that weird dude who chats up women at the supermarket or at the sidewalk.\n \nSo you are gonna be looking for a place where you actively meet new people, and speak to them.\nOne place, where this happens are for example birthday parties/weddings/etc.  But my go-to tip:\n \nClubbing & chatting people up\nYeah the beautiful world of clubbing. At no place it is easier to get laid then there. I know that dancing could be a problem for you all. At my first time at a club, i was just standing there like a tree. But the more often you go, the easier it will get. After 2-3 times it will start to be fun. Go to clubs with music you enjoy, and if you dont know what you like, again: try and error. You will find your style. Also: nobody cares about you dancing. Most wont notice if you dance too hard/too bad. Just enjoy your time.\nAgain, i know what you think: „There are so many good looking dudes in the club. How can i ever keep up with them. Why should any women choose me over the dude with the sixpack?“\nMy answer is simple: Have you seen the men nowadays? No. Fking. Competition.  Most men this day are thirsty af. The era of gentlemen is over. They are either idiots, look like a half assed rapper or are complete assholes. Often times all of that. In their primitive brains they grab and grunt at everything with 2 legs. And i mean that literally. \nBUT – thats good for you. If you just behave like a decent human being, then you are already better than 80% of the other dudes.\n \nOk now we get to the meeting part: And it is actually really simple. You just pick a girl you like and go talk to her. Worst case scenario? – she rejects you and you leave. Then try again (with a different girl.) Dont wait for her to give you a signal ( like smiling at you or a wink) cause lets be real, she most likely wont notice you until you talk to her. Also, try to do it alone. I know it is really tempting to let your friends „wingman“ you, but you wont be taken seriously by any women if you let your friends joke you into a relationship (Hey have you met… doesnt work in real life, i tried it out:D).\nThe best places to chat a girl up in the club are:\n1.      At the bar \nJust walk up to someone, introduce yourself, say that you think she is pretty and that you want to buy her a drink (i know, all these gender-knights are gonna be furious.)

1747;404;343;text;Guide:How to meet women;So yeah, since i started to go on reddit i have seen people cry about not being able to get a girlfriend because they are ugly/shy/too big/too small or whatever. I know how you feel. I am a skinny, black, not so good looking man. I was just like you, all my friends had girlfriends or friends with benefits, and when i asked them „how they did it“, nobody had an answer. But after a lot of try and error, things changed form me. Thats why i decided to make a simple, maybe unethical guide on how to meet women for people with the same problems as i had them, so you dont have to take the long journey of rejections as i have. If i can even help out 1 person with it, then it will be worth it. Brace yourself this is gonna be a long post. (English is my second language, sorry)\nAlso: These is the way on how I meet women. If someone else got a better way then feel free, im pretty sure this is not the only and right way to the goal.\n \nBefore i begin i wanted to say my No.1 rule that i learned:\nWomen are people!\nWomen just like men also have their insecurities, their preferences, their hobbys, their own life. Treat them with respect. They are not a sex-object or an untouchable god in human form. Women are humans, like you and me.\n \nLets start:\n„I am too ugly“ \nYou might think that you are the problem. That you are just dont look good enough for anyone to be attracted to you. I know these are tough words, but unless you are actually physically or mentally disabled (and i dont mean a bit of adhd or autism, i mean the real „its physically impossible to interact with humans“ stuff) its simply not true. If you are in the challenged 1-2% bracket, then this guide can still work for you, but lets be real here, it is going to be a lot harder for you than for the rest. The other 98% of the people look pretty decent if the put in a little bit of work: like brush your teeth, dress nice, comb your hair, shave, …, yeah that pretty much it. And i  know are thinking: UUUHH i am fat, even if i do all these things i am still not good looking. And guess what: Obviously not EVERY girl is going to fall in love with you the second you shave your beard, but like rule no.1 says, every women has her own preference. Some like big/fat dudes, some skinny dudes, some muscular dudes. There will be women who like you/your body type and it is possible that the number is much higher than you think. \n \n„Where can i meet new women?“\n \nFirst of all: you need talk. I know many of you are introverted basement kids. I was too. Gaming / watching netflix is nice, but it holds you back SOOO much. It takes away too much of your time. You gotta force yourself out there, or it is not going to happen. Dont forget, you are not only looking for a girl, but also for a friend. Thats why its called girlfriend. My bet is, that most of the friends you made are from school or work, or friends of friends who you went to school or work with. In school and at work, you are forced to talk to people, it is impossible not to. In you free time nobody will order you to meet someone new. You gotta take it into your own hands and search for them yourself. Nobody is gonna come to you.\nOne rule of socializing that i follow: Never say no if you are invited to something. Always go if it is possible. Rough day at work and tired? You still go. You are lazy and just want to game all night? You still go. You dont want to talk to strangers? You still go. Even if you dont meet your perfect women there, you still might get a nice story to tell at parties to appear interesting.\n My advice to find friends? There are plenty of „find a friend apps“. i know it sounds cringe, but it worked well for me. If you dont know any of those apps: tinder also works not only as a dating-site, but also for a platform to meet new people. Not only women. most men on these sites who are looking for other men are not gay, they are just looking for friends to drink a beer or do some sport together. Get yourself comfortable with talking to strangers, you will see that it is easier than you think.  \nAnd again i know what you think: „I tRiEd TiNdEr aNd I gEt nO mAtcHes (with women)“. Yeah obviously, you are not that good looking, you will only meet men. Like i said, only to socialize.\n„where can i meet new women then?“\nIf you ask this question on reddit, most answers are gonna be like this: „Just find a hobby! Go cooking or something and meet women there. They even got the same interests!“. What bullshit… the moment i read stuff like this, i always imagine a dude signing up for a cooking class, just to find out that its full of horny dudes. What if you like playing football and gaming? i doubt that you can reliably meet new women there. And just trying out new stuff day and night? It will hurt your wallet and sleeping rythm.\nAnother funny answer: „just go to a bar!“ – Yeah idk how it is with your friends, but when i am in a bar with my gang, we just sit and talk by ourselves. No new interactions whatsoever. Or have you ever seen a person just walking up to a group of girls like Barney Stinson? \n \nLittle sidenote: You want to meet people at places where they want to meet new people too. Dont be that weird dude who chats up women at the supermarket or at the sidewalk.\n \nSo you are gonna be looking for a place where you actively meet new people, and speak to them.\nOne place, where this happens are for example birthday parties/weddings/etc.  But my go-to tip:\n \nClubbing & chatting people up\nYeah the beautiful world of clubbing. At no place it is easier to get laid then there. I know that dancing could be a problem for you all. At my first time at a club, i was just standing there like a tree. But the more often you go, the easier it will get. After 2-3 times it will start to be fun. Go to clubs with music you enjoy, and if you dont know what you like, again: try and error. You will find your style. Also: nobody cares about you dancing. Most wont notice if you dance too hard/too bad. Just enjoy your time.\nAgain, i know what you think: „There are so many good looking dudes in the club. How can i ever keep up with them. Why should any women choose me over the dude with the sixpack?“\nMy answer is simple: Have you seen the men nowadays? No. Fking. Competition.  Most men this day are thirsty af. The era of gentlemen is over. They are either idiots, look like a half assed rapper or are complete assholes. Often times all of that. In their primitive brains they grab and grunt at everything with 2 legs. And i mean that literally. \nBUT – thats good for you. If you just behave like a decent human being, then you are already better than 80% of the other dudes.\n \nOk now we get to the meeting part: And it is actually really simple. You just pick a girl you like and go talk to her. Worst case scenario? – she rejects you and you leave. Then try again (with a different girl.) Dont wait for her to give you a signal ( like smiling at you or a wink) cause lets be real, she most likely wont notice you until you talk to her. Also, try to do it alone. I know it is really tempting to let your friends „wingman“ you, but you wont be taken seriously by any women if you let your friends joke you into a relationship (Hey have you met… doesnt work in real life, i tried it out:D).\nThe best places to chat a girl up in the club are:\n1.      At the bar \nJust walk up to someone, introduce yourself, say that you think she is pretty and that you want to buy her a drink (i know, all these gender-knights are gonna be furious.) Easy as that, gets the conversation going. You can ask her what drinks she likes/how old she is (maybe dont forget about that one lol)/ her name / where she works / why she is in the city/ where and who she is here/etc. These are some convo-starters just on the top of my hat. There you can see if she likes you back or not. Women are not stupid, they know what you are up to. Most oft he time if she declines your offer she doesnt like you. If she accepts she does. Suprisingly it is rather rare that i had a girl just abusing me for free drinks, so i wouldnt worry too much about that. Most women dont whore themselves out for a shot.\n \n2.      At the smoking area (only for (party) smokers)\nSame scenario. You pick a girl you like, go up to her and ask her for a lighter or something. Then start talking to her. If she doesnt really respond/walks away straight after smoking she most likely is not interested. If she stays and keeps talking? Nice. \n \nOk, lets assume everything went well and you are now talking/ dancing for a while. What do you do next? First of all you gotta find out if she is single or not. She will probably just tell you that. If not, her clothes are a also a good indicator on the relationship status. If you really cant tell, then just ask her. Is she single and interested in you? Nice. Now to the hard part of this guide.\nSo like i said, Women are not stupid, they know what you are up to. If you are talking to her for that long, she might be interested in more. You want to kiss her now, get the ball into the goal. You want to wait for the right moment, but dont overestimate it. This isnt a movie. There are no fireworks/rain/romantic music in the background. The world wont stand still for you. Just do it. All or nothing. Again, worst case, you get rejected, better luck next time. Dont think about what happens if it doesnt work, think about what happens if it works. \nNow you kiss her and you party the rest of the night? Nice.\n \nIf you missed the right moment, it is fine too. Since you are talking to each other she is likely waiting for you to make a move. But i know it can be hard to notice it sometimes, especially if you are new in the dating world. What you can also do is just straight up ask her if you can kiss her. But there is a chance, that it will be really akward (cause lets be real. Who does that?). \n \nNow the day is coming to an end, you are standing outside/ready to go/saying goodbye there are several options for you:\n1.      You take her home with you/go home with her\nYou can straight up ask her to go home with you. Bold move, i wouldnt recommend it. You are both under the influence, bad idea. Also if she says no and is offended by it, it can crush your previous work. But i know how the horny mind can be sometimes. If she says yes, the rest pretty much goes by itself. You go to your/her place, and the rest is for your biology teacher to explain.\n2.      You go home without her\n \nOk, you will want exchange contact info (Preferably with a number, insta/snap works as well.). Whats really important at this step, is that you give your number to her. You dont ask for her number. Thats because then SHE can decide if she wants to see you again/keep in touch with you. Only she should have your contact info, you should have no way of contacting her. If she writes you a message in the next morning, you know that she wants to see you again. If not, she just had a nice evening and wants to keep it that way. That way you can be sure too if she wants you or not. \n \nDating\nI dont want to go too in depth about dating, just some general advice\n \n-         While texting each other, just write back, dont play games (like waiting extra long to reply to seem busy). Nobody likes people who plays games\n-         Talk about what you are looking for (ONS/F+/relationship/something weird)\n-         I know i dont have to say it but: no dick pics\n-         Dont be afraid to ask for a date/ dont wait too long for it, people lose interest very fast\n-         If you got a date, think about a good place to go where you can talk. (movie theatres for example are a really bad idea, cause you just sit next to each other. Taking a walk together sucks too, cause it is boring af) ( nice ideas are for example: cooking together / going to a bar/ swimming)\n-         If you talk pick suitable themes: pls dont be that weird and boring dude who talks about gaming/anime/school/work, unless she brings it up. \n-         Suitable themes are: if you met before, last night out, funny storys, vacations you took/want to take, etc.. basically everything that doesnt make you sound like a 14 yo. \n-         And most important of all: Respect her. No is no. If she doesnt want to continue, accept it. Dont start simping or stalking or anything. There are millions of women out there, someone will like you.\n \nOk, that was all i wanted to say, maybe it helped you a bit. In the end it all comes down to your own self-esteem. Dont be afraid to socialize. Find friends first, then the love life will follow by itself. Dont be afraid to talk to Women. They are just people.\n \nIf you have questions or didnt understand anything, just ask. I will happily answer (if it is not too personal cause this is still reddit.)\n \n;The era of gentlemen is over.;The era of gentlemen is over.;Éra gentlemanů je pryč.;;;FALSE

Dont be that weird dude who chats up women at the supermarket or at the sidewalk.\n \nSo you are gonna be looking for a place where you actively meet new people, and speak to them.\nOne place, where this happens are for example birthday parties/weddings/etc.  But my go-to tip:\n \nClubbing & chatting people up\nYeah the beautiful world of clubbing. At no place it is easier to get laid then there. I know that dancing could be a problem for you all. At my first time at a club, i was just standing there like a tree. But the more often you go, the easier it will get. After 2-3 times it will start to be fun. Go to clubs with music you enjoy, and if you dont know what you like, again: try and error. You will find your style. Also: nobody cares about you dancing. Most wont notice if you dance too hard/too bad. Just enjoy your time.\nAgain, i know what you think: „There are so many good looking dudes in the club. How can i ever keep up with them. Why should any women choose me over the dude with the sixpack?“\nMy answer is simple: Have you seen the men nowadays? No. Fking. Competition.  Most men this day are thirsty af. The era of gentlemen is over. They are either idiots, look like a half assed rapper or are complete assholes. Often times all of that. In their primitive brains they grab and grunt at everything with 2 legs. And i mean that literally. \nBUT – thats good for you. If you just behave like a decent human being, then you are already better than 80% of the other dudes.\n \nOk now we get to the meeting part: And it is actually really simple. You just pick a girl you like and go talk to her. Worst case scenario? – she rejects you and you leave. Then try again (with a different girl.) Dont wait for her to give you a signal ( like smiling at you or a wink) cause lets be real, she most likely wont notice you until you talk to her. Also, try to do it alone. I know it is really tempting to let your friends „wingman“ you, but you wont be taken seriously by any women if you let your friends joke you into a relationship (Hey have you met… doesnt work in real life, i tried it out:D).\nThe best places to chat a girl up in the club are:\n1.      At the bar \nJust walk up to someone, introduce yourself, say that you think she is pretty and that you want to buy her a drink (i know, all these gender-knights are gonna be furious.) Easy as that, gets the conversation going. You can ask her what drinks she likes/how old she is (maybe dont forget about that one lol)/ her name / where she works / why she is in the city/ where and who she is here/etc. These are some convo-starters just on the top of my hat. There you can see if she likes you back or not. Women are not stupid, they know what you are up to. Most oft he time if she declines your offer she doesnt like you. If she accepts she does. Suprisingly it is rather rare that i had a girl just abusing me for free drinks, so i wouldnt worry too much about that. Most women dont whore themselves out for a shot.\n \n2.      At the smoking area (only for (party) smokers)\nSame scenario. You pick a girl you like, go up to her and ask her for a lighter or something. Then start talking to her. If she doesnt really respond/walks away straight after smoking she most likely is not interested. If she stays and keeps talking? Nice. \n \nOk, lets assume everything went well and you are now talking/ dancing for a while. What do you do next? First of all you gotta find out if she is single or not. She will probably just tell you that. If not, her clothes are a also a good indicator on the relationship status. If you really cant tell, then just ask her. Is she single and interested in you? Nice. Now to the hard part of this guide.\nSo like i said, Women are not stupid, they know what you are up to. If you are talking to her for that long, she might be interested in more. You want to kiss her now, get the ball into the goal. You want to wait for the right moment, but dont overestimate it. This isnt a movie. There are no fireworks/rain/romantic music in the background. The world wont stand still for you. Just do it. All or nothing. Again, worst case, you get rejected, better luck next time. Dont think about what happens if it doesnt work, think about what happens if it works. \nNow you kiss her and you party the rest of the night? Nice.\n \nIf you missed the right moment, it is fine too. Since you are talking to each other she is likely waiting for you to make a move. But i know it can be hard to notice it sometimes, especially if you are new in the dating world. What you can also do is just straight up ask her if you can kiss her. But there is a chance, that it will be really akward (cause lets be real. Who does that?). \n \nNow the day is coming to an end, you are standing outside/ready to go/saying goodbye there are several options for you:\n1.      You take her home with you/go home with her\nYou can straight up ask her to go home with you. Bold move, i wouldnt recommend it. You are both under the influence, bad idea. Also if she says no and is offended by it, it can crush your previous work. But i know how the horny mind can be sometimes. If she says yes, the rest pretty much goes by itself. You go to your/her place, and the rest is for your biology teacher to explain.\n2.      You go home without her\n \nOk, you will want exchange contact info (Preferably with a number, insta/snap works as well.). Whats really important at this step, is that you give your number to her. You dont ask for her number. Thats because then SHE can decide if she wants to see you again/keep in touch with you. Only she should have your contact info, you should have no way of contacting her. If she writes you a message in the next morning, you know that she wants to see you again. If not, she just had a nice evening and wants to keep it that way. That way you can be sure too if she wants you or not. \n \nDating\nI dont want to go too in depth about dating, just some general advice\n \n-         While texting each other, just write back, dont play games (like waiting extra long to reply to seem busy). Nobody likes people who plays games\n-         Talk about what you are looking for (ONS/F+/relationship/something weird)\n-         I know i dont have to say it but: no dick pics\n-         Dont be afraid to ask for a date/ dont wait too long for it, people lose interest very fast\n-         If you got a date, think about a good place to go where you can talk. (movie theatres for example are a really bad idea, cause you just sit next to each other. Taking a walk together sucks too, cause it is boring af) ( nice ideas are for example: cooking together / going to a bar/ swimming)\n-         If you talk pick suitable themes: pls dont be that weird and boring dude who talks about gaming/anime/school/work, unless she brings it up. \n-         Suitable themes are: if you met before, last night out, funny storys, vacations you took/want to take, etc.. basically everything that doesnt make you sound like a 14 yo. \n-         And most important of all: Respect her. No is no. If she doesnt want to continue, accept it. Dont start simping or stalking or anything. There are millions of women out there, someone will like you.\n \nOk, that was all i wanted to say, maybe it helped you a bit. In the end it all comes down to your own self-esteem. Dont be afraid to socialize. Find friends first, then the love life will follow by itself. Dont be afraid to talk to Women. They are just people.\n \nIf you have questions or didnt understand anything, just ask. I will happily answer (if it is not too personal cause this is still reddit.)\n \n;Often times all of that.;Often times all of that.;Dost často všechno dohromady.;;;FALSE
1750;404;343;text;Guide:How to meet women;So yeah, since i started to go on reddit i have seen people cry about not being able to get a girlfriend because they are ugly/shy/too big/too small or whatever. I know how you feel. I am a skinny, black, not so good looking man. I was just like you, all my friends had girlfriends or friends with benefits, and when i asked them „how they did it“, nobody had an answer. But after a lot of try and error, things changed form me. Thats why i decided to make a simple, maybe unethical guide on how to meet women for people with the same problems as i had them, so you dont have to take the long journey of rejections as i have. If i can even help out 1 person with it, then it will be worth it. Brace yourself this is gonna be a long post. (English is my second language, sorry)\nAlso: These is the way on how I meet women. If someone else got a better way then feel free, im pretty sure this is not the only and right way to the goal.\n \nBefore i begin i wanted to say my No.1 rule that i learned:\nWomen are people!\nWomen just like men also have their insecurities, their preferences, their hobbys, their own life. Treat them with respect. They are not a sex-object or an untouchable god in human form. Women are humans, like you and me.\n \nLets start:\n„I am too ugly“ \nYou might think that you are the problem. That you are just dont look good enough for anyone to be attracted to you. I know these are tough words, but unless you are actually physically or mentally disabled (and i dont mean a bit of adhd or autism, i mean the real „its physically impossible to interact with humans“ stuff) its simply not true. If you are in the challenged 1-2% bracket, then this guide can still work for you, but lets be real here, it is going to be a lot harder for you than for the rest. The other 98% of the people look pretty decent if the put in a little bit of work: like brush your teeth, dress nice, comb your hair, shave, …, yeah that pretty much it. And i  know are thinking: UUUHH i am fat, even if i do all these things i am still not good looking. And guess what: Obviously not EVERY girl is going to fall in love with you the second you shave your beard, but like rule no.1 says, every women has her own preference. Some like big/fat dudes, some skinny dudes, some muscular dudes. There will be women who like you/your body type and it is possible that the number is much higher than you think. \n \n„Where can i meet new women?“\n \nFirst of all: you need talk. I know many of you are introverted basement kids. I was too. Gaming / watching netflix is nice, but it holds you back SOOO much. It takes away too much of your time. You gotta force yourself out there, or it is not going to happen. Dont forget, you are not only looking for a girl, but also for a friend. Thats why its called girlfriend. My bet is, that most of the friends you made are from school or work, or friends of friends who you went to school or work with. In school and at work, you are forced to talk to people, it is impossible not to. In you free time nobody will order you to meet someone new. You gotta take it into your own hands and search for them yourself. Nobody is gonna come to you.\nOne rule of socializing that i follow: Never say no if you are invited to something. Always go if it is possible. Rough day at work and tired? You still go. You are lazy and just want to game all night? You still go. You dont want to talk to strangers? You still go. Even if you dont meet your perfect women there, you still might get a nice story to tell at parties to appear interesting.\n My advice to find friends? There are plenty of „find a friend apps“. i know it sounds cringe, but it worked well for me. If you dont know any of those apps: tinder also works not only as a dating-site, but also for a platform to meet new people. Not only women. most men on these sites who are looking for other men are not gay, they are just looking for friends to drink a beer or do some sport together. Get yourself comfortable with talking to strangers, you will see that it is easier than you think.  \nAnd again i know what you think: „I tRiEd TiNdEr aNd I gEt nO mAtcHes (with women)“. Yeah obviously, you are not that good looking, you will only meet men. Like i said, only to socialize.\n„where can i meet new women then?“\nIf you ask this question on reddit, most answers are gonna be like this: „Just find a hobby! Go cooking or something and meet women there. They even got the same interests!“. What bullshit… the moment i read stuff like this, i always imagine a dude signing up for a cooking class, just to find out that its full of horny dudes. What if you like playing football and gaming? i doubt that you can reliably meet new women there. And just trying out new stuff day and night? It will hurt your wallet and sleeping rythm.\nAnother funny answer: „just go to a bar!“ – Yeah idk how it is with your friends, but when i am in a bar with my gang, we just sit and talk by ourselves. No new interactions whatsoever. Or have you ever seen a person just walking up to a group of girls like Barney Stinson? \n \nLittle sidenote: You want to meet people at places where they want to meet new people too. Dont be that weird dude who chats up women at the supermarket or at the sidewalk.\n \nSo you are gonna be looking for a place where you actively meet new people, and speak to them.\nOne place, where this happens are for example birthday parties/weddings/etc.  But my go-to tip:\n \nClubbing & chatting people up\nYeah the beautiful world of clubbing. At no place it is easier to get laid then there. I know that dancing could be a problem for you all. At my first time at a club, i was just standing there like a tree. But the more often you go, the easier it will get. After 2-3 times it will start to be fun. Go to clubs with music you enjoy, and if you dont know what you like, again: try and error. You will find your style. Also: nobody cares about you dancing. Most wont notice if you dance too hard/too bad. Just enjoy your time.\nAgain, i know what you think: „There are so many good looking dudes in the club. How can i ever keep up with them. Why should any women choose me over the dude with the sixpack?“\nMy answer is simple: Have you seen the men nowadays? No. Fking. Competition.  Most men this day are thirsty af. The era of gentlemen is over. They are either idiots, look like a half assed rapper or are complete assholes. Often times all of that. In their primitive brains they grab and grunt at everything with 2 legs. And i mean that literally. \nBUT – thats good for you. If you just behave like a decent human being, then you are already better than 80% of the other dudes.\n \nOk now we get to the meeting part: And it is actually really simple.

Whats really important at this step, is that you give your number to her. You dont ask for her number. Thats because then SHE can decide if she wants to see you again/keep in touch with you. Only she should have your contact info, you should have no way of contacting her. If she writes you a message in the next morning, you know that she wants to see you again. If not, she just had a nice evening and wants to keep it that way. That way you can be sure too if she wants you or not. \n \nDating\nI dont want to go too in depth about dating, just some general advice\n \n-         While texting each other, just write back, dont play games (like waiting extra long to reply to seem busy). Nobody likes people who plays games\n-         Talk about what you are looking for (ONS/F+/relationship/something weird)\n-         I know i dont have to say it but: no dick pics\n-         Dont be afraid to ask for a date/ dont wait too long for it, people lose interest very fast\n-         If you got a date, think about a good place to go where you can talk. (movie theatres for example are a really bad idea, cause you just sit next to each other. Taking a walk together sucks too, cause it is boring af) ( nice ideas are for example: cooking together / going to a bar/ swimming)\n-         If you talk pick suitable themes: pls dont be that weird and boring dude who talks about gaming/anime/school/work, unless she brings it up. \n-         Suitable themes are: if you met before, last night out, funny storys, vacations you took/want to take, etc.. basically everything that doesnt make you sound like a 14 yo. \n-         And most important of all: Respect her. No is no. If she doesnt want to continue, accept it. Dont start simping or stalking or anything. There are millions of women out there, someone will like you.\n \nOk, that was all i wanted to say, maybe it helped you a bit. In the end it all comes down to your own self-esteem. Dont be afraid to socialize. Find friends first, then the love life will follow by itself. Dont be afraid to talk to Women. They are just people.\n \nIf you have questions or didnt understand anything, just ask.

1752;404;343;text;Guide:How to meet women;So yeah, since i started to go on reddit i have seen people cry about not being able to get a girlfriend because they are ugly/shy/too big/too small or whatever. I know how you feel. I am a skinny, black, not so good looking man. I was just like you, all my friends had girlfriends or friends with benefits, and when i asked them „how they did it“, nobody had an answer. But after a lot of try and error, things changed form me. Thats why i decided to make a simple, maybe unethical guide on how to meet women for people with the same problems as i had them, so you dont have to take the long journey of rejections as i have. If i can even help out 1 person with it, then it will be worth it. Brace yourself this is gonna be a long post. (English is my second language, sorry)\nAlso: These is the way on how I meet women. If someone else got a better way then feel free, im pretty sure this is not the only and right way to the goal.\n \nBefore i begin i wanted to say my No.1 rule that i learned:\nWomen are people!\nWomen just like men also have their insecurities, their preferences, their hobbys, their own life. Treat them with respect. They are not a sex-object or an untouchable god in human form. Women are humans, like you and me.\n \nLets start:\n„I am too ugly“ \nYou might think that you are the problem. That you are just dont look good enough for anyone to be attracted to you. I know these are tough words, but unless you are actually physically or mentally disabled (and i dont mean a bit of adhd or autism, i mean the real „its physically impossible to interact with humans“ stuff) its simply not true. If you are in the challenged 1-2% bracket, then this guide can still work for you, but lets be real here, it is going to be a lot harder for you than for the rest. The other 98% of the people look pretty decent if the put in a little bit of work: like brush your teeth, dress nice, comb your hair, shave, …, yeah that pretty much it. And i  know are thinking: UUUHH i am fat, even if i do all these things i am still not good looking. And guess what: Obviously not EVERY girl is going to fall in love with you the second you shave your beard, but like rule no.1 says, every women has her own preference. Some like big/fat dudes, some skinny dudes, some muscular dudes. There will be women who like you/your body type and it is possible that the number is much higher than you think. \n \n„Where can i meet new women?“\n \nFirst of all: you need talk. I know many of you are introverted basement kids. I was too. Gaming / watching netflix is nice, but it holds you back SOOO much. It takes away too much of your time. You gotta force yourself out there, or it is not going to happen. Dont forget, you are not only looking for a girl, but also for a friend. Thats why its called girlfriend. My bet is, that most of the friends you made are from school or work, or friends of friends who you went to school or work with. In school and at work, you are forced to talk to people, it is impossible not to. In you free time nobody will order you to meet someone new. You gotta take it into your own hands and search for them yourself. Nobody is gonna come to you.\nOne rule of socializing that i follow: Never say no if you are invited to something. Always go if it is possible. Rough day at work and tired? You still go. You are lazy and just want to game all night? You still go. You dont want to talk to strangers? You still go. Even if you dont meet your perfect women there, you still might get a nice story to tell at parties to appear interesting.\n My advice to find friends? There are plenty of „find a friend apps“. i know it sounds cringe, but it worked well for me. If you dont know any of those apps: tinder also works not only as a dating-site, but also for a platform to meet new people. Not only women. most men on these sites who are looking for other men are not gay, they are just looking for friends to drink a beer or do some sport together. Get yourself comfortable with talking to strangers, you will see that it is easier than you think.  \nAnd again i know what you think: „I tRiEd TiNdEr aNd I gEt nO mAtcHes (with women)“. Yeah obviously, you are not that good looking, you will only meet men. Like i said, only to socialize.\n„where can i meet new women then?“\nIf you ask this question on reddit, most answers are gonna be like this: „Just find a hobby! Go cooking or something and meet women there. They even got the same interests!“. What bullshit… the moment i read stuff like this, i always imagine a dude signing up for a cooking class, just to find out that its full of horny dudes. What if you like playing football and gaming? i doubt that you can reliably meet new women there. And just trying out new stuff day and night? It will hurt your wallet and sleeping rythm.\nAnother funny answer: „just go to a bar!“ – Yeah idk how it is with your friends, but when i am in a bar with my gang, we just sit and talk by ourselves. No new interactions whatsoever. Or have you ever seen a person just walking up to a group of girls like Barney Stinson? \n \nLittle sidenote: You want to meet people at places where they want to meet new people too. Dont be that weird dude who chats up women at the supermarket or at the sidewalk.\n \nSo you are gonna be looking for a place where you actively meet new people, and speak to them.\nOne place, where this happens are for example birthday parties/weddings/etc.  But my go-to tip:\n \nClubbing & chatting people up\nYeah the beautiful world of clubbing. At no place it is easier to get laid then there. I know that dancing could be a problem for you all. At my first time at a club, i was just standing there like a tree. But the more often you go, the easier it will get. After 2-3 times it will start to be fun. Go to clubs with music you enjoy, and if you dont know what you like, again: try and error. You will find your style. Also: nobody cares about you dancing. Most wont notice if you dance too hard/too bad. Just enjoy your time.\nAgain, i know what you think: „There are so many good looking dudes in the club. How can i ever keep up with them. Why should any women choose me over the dude with the sixpack?“\nMy answer is simple: Have you seen the men nowadays? No. Fking. Competition.  Most men this day are thirsty af. The era of gentlemen is over. They are either idiots, look like a half assed rapper or are complete assholes. Often times all of that. In their primitive brains they grab and grunt at everything with 2 legs. And i mean that literally. \nBUT – thats good for you. If you just behave like a decent human being, then you are already better than 80% of the other dudes.\n \nOk now we get to the meeting part: And it is actually really simple. You just pick a girl you like and go talk to her. Worst case scenario? – she rejects you and you leave. Then try again (with a different girl.) Dont wait for her to give you a signal ( like smiling at you or a wink) cause lets be real, she most likely wont notice you until you talk to her. Also, try to do it alone. I know it is really tempting to let your friends „wingman“ you, but you wont be taken seriously by any women if you let your friends joke you into a relationship (Hey have you met… doesnt work in real life, i tried it out:D).\nThe best places to chat a girl up in the club are:\n1.      At the bar \nJust walk up to someone, introduce yourself, say that you think she is pretty and that you want to buy her a drink (i know, all these gender-knights are gonna be furious.) Easy as that, gets the conversation going. You can ask her what drinks she likes/how old she is (maybe dont forget about that one lol)/ her name / where she works / why she is in the city/ where and who she is here/etc. These are some convo-starters just on the top of my hat. There you can see if she likes you back or not. Women are not stupid, they know what you are up to. Most oft he time if she declines your offer she doesnt like you. If she accepts she does. Suprisingly it is rather rare that i had a girl just abusing me for free drinks, so i wouldnt worry too much about that. Most women dont whore themselves out for a shot.\n \n2.      At the smoking area (only for (party) smokers)\nSame scenario. You pick a girl you like, go up to her and ask her for a lighter or something. Then start talking to her. If she doesnt really respond/walks away straight after smoking she most likely is not interested. If she stays and keeps talking? Nice. \n \nOk, lets assume everything went well and you are now talking/ dancing for a while. What do you do next? First of all you gotta find out if she is single or not. She will probably just tell you that. If not, her clothes are a also a good indicator on the relationship status. If you really cant tell, then just ask her. Is she single and interested in you? Nice. Now to the hard part of this guide.\nSo like i said, Women are not stupid, they know what you are up to. If you are talking to her for that long, she might be interested in more. You want to kiss her now, get the ball into the goal. You want to wait for the right moment, but dont overestimate it. This isnt a movie. There are no fireworks/rain/romantic music in the background. The world wont stand still for you. Just do it. All or nothing. Again, worst case, you get rejected, better luck next time. Dont think about what happens if it doesnt work, think about what happens if it works. \nNow you kiss her and you party the rest of the night? Nice.\n \nIf you missed the right moment, it is fine too. Since you are talking to each other she is likely waiting for you to make a move. But i know it can be hard to notice it sometimes, especially if you are new in the dating world. What you can also do is just straight up ask her if you can kiss her. But there is a chance, that it will be really akward (cause lets be real. Who does that?). \n \nNow the day is coming to an end, you are standing outside/ready to go/saying goodbye there are several options for you:\n1.      You take her home with you/go home with her\nYou can straight up ask her to go home with you. Bold move, i wouldnt recommend it. You are both under the influence, bad idea. Also if she says no and is offended by it, it can crush your previous work. But i know how the horny mind can be sometimes. If she says yes, the rest pretty much goes by itself. You go to your/her place, and the rest is for your biology teacher to explain.\n2.      You go home without her\n \nOk, you will want exchange contact info (Preferably with a number, insta/snap works as well.). Whats really important at this step, is that you give your number to her. You dont ask for her number. Thats because then SHE can decide if she wants to see you again/keep in touch with you.

If not, she just had a nice evening and wants to keep it that way. That way you can be sure too if she wants you or not. \n \nDating\nI dont want to go too in depth about dating, just some general advice\n \n-         While texting each other, just write back, dont play games (like waiting extra long to reply to seem busy). Nobody likes people who plays games\n-         Talk about what you are looking for (ONS/F+/relationship/something weird)\n-         I know i dont have to say it but: no dick pics\n-         Dont be afraid to ask for a date/ dont wait too long for it, people lose interest very fast\n-         If you got a date, think about a good place to go where you can talk.

Unfortunately, the workload, the immature people, and drunken parties are all pretty on par. Even your bully is the same one you've had since high school.

C’mere, loser!” \n\n[A gent you are unfortunately very familiar with staggers towards you with a big grin and throws an arm around you] \n\n“Heeeyy, there. How’s my favorite loser tonight, hmm? Looking around all nervous to see if someone is gonna pants you again? Enh, let’s see…Tug, tug…hehe, you remembered a belt this time! Good job, shit-for-brains. You’re learning useful skills this time!” \n\n[Pause] \n\n“Hehe, aww. Not gonna have a drink? Little drinky drink, loosen up those airtight nerd bloomers? Mhh, there is a pool, you know… I bet I could toss you right in. Get a peek at some of that pasty nerd ass, hehe.” \n\n[Pause] \n\n“Pfft, whaaaa…? Me drunk? Psshh. Nah. I’m not a lightweight. Not like yooouuu are, nerd. Oh, beans, woogh…All shaky, haha. You’re a good walking stick. Haayy, ahh, who invited you out anyway?” \n\n[Pause] \n\n[He laughs obnoxiously and ruffles your hair] \n\n“Aww, and you, hhgh, fell for that? Dude, c’mon, Sara is NOTORIOUS for pulling this shit. You’ll be way better off if you leave ‘fore she sees you, otherwise you’re gonna wind up waterboarded with vodka.” \n\n[Pause] \n\n[It’s very brief but you see his infuriating smile turn soft, genuine] \n\n“Heyyy, I’m proud of you, though! Getting out and about like a grown-up instead of hidin’ away all day, making out with your computer screen. Heehee, aww, these little cheeks. Pinch pinch, hehe.” \n\n[You slap his hands away and, as he usually does, he just laughs] \n\n“Cute.” \n\n[Pause???] \n\n“U-Uh, I… I mean that it’s cute you thought you made a friend. After the whole thing with Danielle, you-”. \n\n[He stumbles back a bit as you give him a shove] \n\n“Whoa, hey! S’ not my fault your shitty childhood bestie turned out to have an appetite for your ex’s junk, OK?” \n\n[Pause] \n\n“...fuck, I’m sorry, OK? I get it… It took me a long time to make the friends I, hic, have here, and they mean a lot to me. Maybe if you quit being a nerd, I can…” \n\n[He doubles over with a groan] \n\n[Pause?!] \n\n“Guhh, no, I’m great… Just forgot you should eat food before alcohol. Fuck, I think I left my meds at home, too…” \n\n[Pause…] \n\n“Where do I live? Enh, it’s like an hour and a half walk. You know that pizza place that’s been closed down like five, hhk, times? Yeah, the apartments behind that.” \n\n[Pause] \n\n“...really? You’d just…give me a ride home?” \n\n[Pause] \n\n[He snorts and shakes his head] \n\n“So down bad… Thanks but Tanner’s got me.”\n\n[You side-eye Tanner. He’s currently doing jello shots at an alarming rate] \n\n[Pause…] \n\n“Pfft, I think you just want in my pants which, aha, good luck, nerd.” \n\n[Pause!] \n\n“OK, OK, dayyuummm! Feisty, feisty…”\n\n[You get him in your car and buckled in while he rambles and grumbles under his breath] \n\n[SFX: Car doors opening, then closing, then the car turning on] \n\n“Bluegh, you’re such a buzzkill, you know that? Tanner’s a legit designated driver!” \n\n[Pause] \n\n“OK, maybe he was a lil tipsy, but he’s always gotten us, hrk, home. I bet you just wanted to spend more time with me, huh? You’re sooo down bad for me.”\n\n[Pause] \n\n“Ohhh, OK, sure you can’t stand me. You make those kissy eyes whenever I’m, bluh, around.” \n\n[Pause] \n\n“Ohhhhh, just glaring, huh? OK, OK, well if I’m such an idiot, then how’s about you tell me how you *do* feel, hm? Hehe, you won’t, you don’t have the balls.” \n\n[You take a deep breath, desperately trying to focus on the road while he giggles and sways in his seat] \n\n“C’moooon. Just admit you’re in love with me. Wait, wait, hang on, let me make sure my phone is recording, hehe, this is going to be GOLD. OK, ready!” \n\n[Something snaps. Before you know it, you’re shouting every foul thing about him while he stares at you, dumbfounded. You spare nothing, you practically crucify the poor man for a solid ten minutes before you roll up to his house] \n\n[Pause…] \n\n[He sits and stares at you. You can’t tell in the dim light whether it’s the alcohol making his eyes water or actual tears. But you don’t care] \n\n“...h-huh?” \n\n[Pause] \n\n“G-Get the fuck out of your car…? W-Wait, c’mon, we’re not going to talk about…any of the shit you just screamed at me? How I’m an immature, abusive dick that couldn’t, hhk, land someone with more than five IQ? O-Or about how I’m a piece of trash for admitting to letting a friend drive drunk? Or…or about you…hate me…?” \n\n[Pause] \n\n“...O-OK.” \n\n[He undoes his seatbelt and shakily exits the car. He makes it about two steps before he falls to his knees in the grass and violently vomits] \n\n[...Pause…] \n\n[SFX: Him retching and sobbing] \n\n[For a moment, you almost consider getting out to help him again…but think better and head off, leaving him passed out in his own vomit] \n\n****[Time Transition: The next morning]**** \n\n[SFX: Lots of chatter, shoes squeaking on linoleum tile] \n\n[You’re on your way to your first class of the day when you see a large group of students gathered around one of the teachers.

Hey, you!” \n\n[A hand grabs your shoulder and spins you around - it’s him] \n\n“You thought you could dunk on me that hard and just walk away, huh? Well, it’s a good thing there’s a crowd, because-...W-Why are you hugging me all of a sudden?” \n\n[...Pause…] \n\n“...t-they…a car accident…?” \n\n[He falls limp against you as the teacher clarifies to the somber crowd] \n\n“Did…d-did anyone…N-No, c’mon Mr. Jenkins! Y-You can’t…please…?” \n\n[Pause] \n\n“All dead…” \n\n[He tenses briefly before he collapses in your arms, sobbing, holding on to you for dear life.

From what I’ve heard you can apply for unpaid leave for weddings and other important events. Obviously Glastonbury probably won’t fall into that category for my headteacher and I was wondering if anyone had any experience getting time off to be able to go to Glastonbury for the 4/5 days or is it just a case of turning up Friday evening and going home Sunday evening? \n\nThanks !;Hi guys, this year was my third year at glasto and I loved it sooo much and hope u guys did too !;Hi guys, this year was my third year at Glastonbury, and I loved it so much and hope you guys did too!;Ahoj lidi, letos jsem byl potřetí na festivalu v Glastonbury a hrozně moc se mi tam líbilo a doufám, že vám taky!;;;FALSE
